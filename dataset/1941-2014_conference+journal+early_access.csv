Software testing and V&V (Verification and Validation) activities are very important for assuring high software quality. If we can predict the risky modules in safety-critical software, testing activities and regulation activities can be applied to them more intensively. In this paper, we classify the estimated risk classes which can be used for deep testing and V&V. We predict the risk class for each module using support vector machines. We can consider that the modules classified to risk class 5 or 4 are more risky than others relatively. For all classification error rates, we expect that the results can be useful and practical for software testing, V&V, and activities for regulatory reviews. In the future works, to improve the practicality, we will have to investigate other machine learning algorithms and datasets.","","","10.1109/ICIS.2009.83","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5223201","Safety-Critical Software;SVM;Software Testing;Software V&V","Software safety;Support vector machines;Support vector machine classification;Software metrics;Software testing;Machine learning;Kernel;Space technology;Software quality;Classification tree analysis","learning (artificial intelligence);program testing;safety-critical software;software quality;support vector machines","risky module estimation;safety-critical software;safety-critical system;software testing;software quality;testing activities;regulation activities;support vector machines;classification error rates;machine learning algorithms","","1","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contribution of stakeholders contributing in software requirements have a place with distinctive domains, because of which ambiguities, inconsistencies might arise moreover giving rise to incorrectness. Many tools are available for software requirements verification and validation but the issue of stakeholders belonging to different domains is still under consideration. As these requirements are not understood properly, it causes schedule delay and greater cost in the last stages of software. Requirements verification and validation are the most vital activities in requirement engineering that guarantees software quality and has an extraordinary impact on software cost and its success. The requirements verification and validation are an affirmation that the product requirements record is free of unwanted requirements and totally reliable. Keeping in mind the end goal of removing conflict, recognizing failures and making the product requirements document completely useful is the key component. So these requirements should be appropriately confirmed and accepted by the clients before conveying to the development team. Thus, ontology might be picked as an answer for checking and approving the requirements among stakeholders of distinctive domains. In this study improving requirement verification and validation process through ontology. We have used expert reviews and case study to evaluate the developed ontology that indicates different concepts, properties and constraints in the process of requirement verification and validation.

In this type of quality modeling we assume that software modules with known fault content developed in similar environment are available. Supervised learning algorithms are the traditional methods of choice for training on existing modules. The models are then used to predict fault content for newly developed software components prior to product release. However, one needs to realize that establishing whether a module contains a fault or not, only to be used for model training, can be expensive. The basic idea behind semi-supervised learning is to learn from a small number of software modules with known fault content and supplement model training with modules for which the fault information is not available, thus reducing the overall cost of quality assurance. In this study, we investigate the performance of semi-supervised learning for software fault prediction. A preprocessing strategy, multidimensional scaling, is embedded in the approach to reduce the dimensional complexity of software metrics used for prediction. Our results show that the dimension-reduction with semi-supervised learning algorithm preforms significantly better than one of the best performing supervised learning algorithm - random forest - in situations when few modules with known fault content are available.

To help address the quality of such software, in this paper we present a technique for testing the implementations of supervised machine learning classification algorithms on which such scientific computing software depends. Our technique is based on an approach called ""metamorphic testing"", which has been shown to be effective in such cases. More importantly, we demonstrate that our technique not only serves the purpose of verification, but also can be applied in validation. In addition to presenting our technique, we describe a case study we performed on a real-world machine learning application framework, and discuss how programmers implementing machine learning algorithms can avoid the common pitfalls discovered in our study.

We show that some features can carry significant nonlinear information about the defect content. Therefore, we use a nonlinear regression technique, neural networks, to solve the learning problem. To select the best among all neural networks trained on a given data set, one usually reserves part of the data set for later cross-validation; in contrast, we use a technique which leaves the full data set for training. This is an advantage when the data set is small. We validate our approach on a known empirical inspection data set. For that benchmark, our novel approach clearly outperforms both linear regression and the current standard methods in software engineering for estimating the defect content, such as capture-recapture. The validation also shows that our machine learning approach can be successful even when the empirical inspection data set is small.","","","10.1109/TSE.2004.1265733","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265733","","Machine learning;Inspection;Neural networks;Software engineering;Curve fitting;Linear regression;Software standards;Software testing;Quality assurance;Estimation error","learning (artificial intelligence);regression analysis;neural nets;program verification;program testing","defect content estimation;machine learning;nonlinear regression technique;neural network;empirical methods;software engineering;software inspection;program validation","","12","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For each coding layer, we regularize the RBM by encouraging representations to fit both sparse and selective distributions. Supervised fine-tuning is used to enhance the quality of the visual representation for the categorization task. We performed a thorough experimental evaluation using three image categorization data sets. The hierarchical coding scheme achieved competitive categorization accuracies of 79.7% and 86.4% on the Caltech-101 and 15-Scenes data sets, respectively. The visual representations learned are compact and the model's inference is fast, as compared with sparse coding methods. The low-level representations of descriptors that were learned using this method result in generic features that we empirically found to be transferrable between different image data sets.

They identify software subsystems (modules,components, classes, or files) which are likely to contain faults. These subsystems, in turn, receive additional resources for verification and validation activities. Fault prediction models are binary classifiers typically developed using one of the supervised learning techniques from either a subset of the fault data from the current project or from a similar past project. In practice, it is critical that such models provide a reliable prediction performance on the data not used in training. Variance is an important reliability indicator of software fault prediction models. However, variance is often ignored or barely mentioned in many published studies. In this paper, through the analysis of twelve data sets from a public software engineering repository from the perspective of variance, we explore the following five questions regarding fault prediction models: (1) Do different types ofclassification performance measures exhibit different variance? (2) Does the size of the data set imply a more (or less) accurate prediction performance? (3) Does the size of training subset impact model's stability? (4) Do different classifiers consistently exhibit different performance in terms of model's variance? (5) Are there differences between variance from 1000 runs and 10 runs of 10-fold cross validation experiments? Our results indicate that variance is a very important factor in understanding fault prediction models and we recommend the best practice for reporting variance in empirical software engineering studies.","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2009.13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5362090","variance;fault prediction models;machine learning","Analysis of variance;Predictive models;Software quality;Software engineering;Fault diagnosis;Supervised learning;Data analysis;Performance analysis;Software measurement;Stability","learning (artificial intelligence);software fault tolerance;software quality;statistical analysis","variance analysis;software fault prediction model;software quality assurance;binary classifier;supervised learning;reliability indicator","","35","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the notable progress made in the field, there remains a need for an architecture that can represent temporal information with the same ease that spatial information is discovered. In this work, we present new results using a recently introduced deep learning architecture called Deep Spatio-Temporal Inference Network (DeSTIN). DeSTIN is a discriminative deep learning architecture that combines concepts from unsupervised learning for dynamic pattern representation together with Bayesian inference. In DeSTIN the spatiotemporal dependencies that exist within the observations are modeled inherently in an unguided manner. Each node models the inputs by means of clustering and simple dynamics modeling while it constructs a belief state over the distribution of sequences using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that information from the different layers of this hierarchical system can be extracted and utilized for the purpose of pattern classification.

Many existing approaches fail to provide favorable results due to being: 1) shallow in architecture; 2) hand engineered in features; and 3) separate in learning. In this paper we propose a deep architecture that consists of two parts, i.e., a deep belief network (DBN) at the bottom and a multitask regression layer at the top. A DBN is employed here for unsupervised feature learning. It can learn effective features for traffic flow prediction in an unsupervised fashion, which has been examined and found to be effective for many areas such as image and audio classification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that applies the deep learning approach to transportation research. To incorporate multitask learning (MTL) in our deep architecture, a multitask regression layer is used above the DBN for supervised prediction. We further investigate homogeneous MTL and heterogeneous MTL for traffic flow prediction. To take full advantage of weight sharing in our deep architecture, we propose a grouping method based on the weights in the top layer to make MTL more effective. Experiments on transportation data sets show good performance of our deep architecture. Abundant experiments show that our approach achieved close to 5% improvements over the state of the art. It is also presented that MTL can improve the generalization performance of shared tasks.

Most current transfer-learning methods focus on scenarios where the auxiliary and the target learning tasks are very similar: either (some of) the auxiliary data can be directly used as training examples for the target task or the auxiliary and the target data share the same representation. However, in many cases the connection between the auxiliary and the target tasks can be remote. Only a few features derived from the auxiliary data may be helpful for the target learning. We call such scenario the deep transfer-learning scenario and we introduce a novel transfer-learning method for deep transfer. Our method uses restricted Boltzmann machine to discover a set of hierarchical features from the auxiliary data. We then select from these features a subset that are helpful for the target learning, using a selection criterion based on the concept of kernel-target alignment. Finally, the target data are augmented with the selected features before training. Our experiment results show that this transfer method is effective.

However, most of acoustic representations characterize all different kinds of information as whole, which could hinder either a speech or a speaker recognition (SR) system from producing a better performance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural architecture (DNA) especially for learning speaker-specific characteristics from mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, an acoustic representation commonly used in both speech recognition and SR, which results in a speaker-specific overcomplete representation. In order to learn intrinsic speaker-specific characteristics, we come up with an objective function consisting of contrastive losses in terms of speaker similarity/dissimilarity and data reconstruction losses used as regularization to normalize the interference of non-speaker-related information. Moreover, we employ a hybrid learning strategy for learning parameters of the deep neural networks: i.e., local yet greedy layerwise unsupervised pretraining for initialization and global supervised learning for the ultimate discriminative goal. With four Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) benchmarks and two non-English corpora, we demonstrate that our overcomplete representation is robust in characterizing various speakers, no matter whether their utterances have been used in training our DNA, and highly insensitive to text and languages spoken. Extensive comparative studies suggest that our approach yields favorite results in speaker verification and segmentation. Finally, we discuss several issues concerning our proposed approach.","","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2167240","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026951","Deep neural architecture;hybrid learning strategy;overcomplete representation;speaker comparison;speaker segmentation;speaker verification;speaker-specific characteristics","Speech;DNA;Speech processing;Neurons;Strontium;Speech recognition;Learning systems","cepstral analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);natural languages;neural net architecture;speaker recognition","learning speaker-specific characteristics;deep neural architecture;speech signal;acoustic representation;speaker recognition system;speaker-specific characteristics learning;mel-frequency cepstral coefficient;speaker similarity;data reconstruction loss;nonspeaker-related information;hybrid learning strategy;supervised learning;linguistic data consortium benchmark;nonEnglish corpora;languages spoken;speaker verification;speaker segmentation","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Systems;Discrimination Learning;Humans;Language;Models, Neurological;Neural Networks (Computer);Normal Distribution;Speech Recognition Software","46","41","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This fundamental goal complements another essential goal in education, improving understanding of how humans acquire knowledge and how students may vary in their abilities to learn. Contributing to both goals, a lot of efforts have been made to develop intelligent agents that simulate human learning of math and science. However, constructing such a learning agent currently requires manual encoding of prior domain knowledge, which is both inefficient and less cognitively plausible. Previous cognitive science research has shown that one of the key factors that differentiates experts and novices is their different representations of knowledge. Moreover, for many existing learning algorithms, “better” representations often lead to more effective learning. We [1] recently proposed an efficient algorithm that acquires representation knowledge in the form of “deep features”. In this paper, we integrate this algorithm into a simulated student, SimStudent, which learns procedural knowledge from example solutions and problem solving experience. We show that with the integration, prior knowledge engineering effort is reduced, learning performance is as good or better, and SimStudent becomes a more plausible simulation of human learning.","","","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400851","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400851","","Intelligent agents;Humans;Knowledge engineering;Mathematical model;Production;Equations;Learning systems","knowledge representation;learning by example;software agents","perceptual representation learning;skill learning;simulated student;artificial intelligence;intelligent agents;human-level intelligence;education;human learning;learning agent;learning algorithms;knowledge representation;SimStudent;procedural knowledge learning;knowledge engineering;learning performance","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this brief, we propose a new feature extraction method called regularized deep Fisher mapping (RDFM), which learns an explicit mapping from the sample space to the feature space using a deep neural network to enhance the separability of features according to the Fisher criterion. Compared to kernel methods, the deep neural network is a deep and nonlocal learning architecture, and therefore exhibits more powerful ability to learn the nature of highly variable datasets from fewer samples. To eliminate the side effects of overfitting brought about by the large capacity of powerful learners, regularizers are applied in the learning procedure of RDFM. RDFM is evaluated in various types of datasets, and the results reveal that it is necessary to apply unsupervised regularization in the fine-tuning phase of deep learning. Thus, for very flexible models, the optimal Fisher feature extractor may be a balance between discriminative ability and descriptive ability.","","","10.1109/TNN.2011.2162429","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5982410","Deep learning architecture;feature extraction;Fisher criterion;regularization","Feature extraction;Kernel;Machine learning;Training;Computer architecture;Neurons;Learning systems","feature extraction;image classification;neural nets;unsupervised learning","class separability;regularized deep Fisher mapping;feature space;deep neural network;Fisher criterion;nonlocal learning architecture;RDFM;unsupervised regularization;fine tuning phase;optimal Fisher feature extractor;discriminative ability;descriptive ability;classification tasks","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Humans;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Design","27","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It may bring human beings to a higher cognitive level of data. Its unsupervised pre-training step allows us to find high-dimensional representations or abstract features which work much better than the principal component analysis (PCA) method. However, it will face problems when being applied to deal with large scale data due to its intensive computation from many levels of training process against large scale data. The sequential deep learning algorithms usually can not finish the computation in an acceptable time. In this paper, we propose a many-core algorithm which is based on a parallel method and is used in the Intel Xeon Phi many-core systems to speed up the unsupervised training process of Sparse Autoencoder and Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). Using the sequential training algorithm as a baseline to compare, we adopted several optimization methods to parallelize the algorithm. The experimental results show that our fully-optimized algorithm gains more than 300-fold speedup on parallelized Sparse Autoencoder compared with the original sequential algorithm on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor. Also, we ran the fully-optimized code on both the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor and an expensive Intel Xeon CPU. Our method on the Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor is 7 to 10 times faster than the Intel Xeon CPU for this application. In addition to this, we compared our fully-optimized code on the Intel Xeon Phi with a Matlab code running on single Intel Xeon CPU. Our method on the Intel Xeon Phi runs 16 times faster than the Matlab implementation. The result also suggests that the Intel Xeon Phi can offer an efficient but more general-purposed way to parallelize the deep learning algorithm compared to GPU. It also achieves faster speed with better parallelism than the Intel Xeon CPU.","","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2014.194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6969570","Deep learning;Unsupervised learning;Deep architecture;Sparse autoencoder;Restricted Boltzmann Machine;Parallel algorithm;Intel Xeon Phi;Many-core","Training;Neural networks;Coprocessors;Unsupervised learning;Algorithm design and analysis;Vectors;Feature extraction","Boltzmann machines;coprocessors;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;parallel processing","deep neural network training;Intel Xeon Phi many-core coprocessor;machine learning research;sequential deep learning algorithms;parallel method;unsupervised training process;restricted Boltzmann machine;RBM;sequential training algorithm;optimization methods;fully-optimized algorithm;parallelized sparse autoencoder;Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor;Matlab code","","12","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multi-label learning is accordingly transformed to multiple binary-class classification tasks. Considering that a deep neural nets (DNN) architecture can learn good intermediate representations shared across tasks, we generalize one classification task of traditional DNN into multiple binary classification tasks through defining the output layer with a negative class node and a positive class node for each label. After a similar pretraining process to deep belief nets, we redefine the label assignment error of MT-DNN and perform the back-propagation algorithm to fine-tune the network. To evaluate the proposed model, we carry out image annotation experiments on two public image datasets, with 2000 images and 30,000 images respectively.

The recent advance of deep neural network (DNN) can help to solve this problem, since the DNN is found to better capture the essential attributes of images. We in this paper therefore introduce a new Deep learning based Image Quality Index (DIQI) for blind quality assessment.

We live in a time of confusion, common to moments in time where there is a historical transition between different types of society. This situation has led to a substantial change in the professional needs, competencies and skills required by individuals in order to progress in the Net society. It is imperative for individuals to re-examine their professional development and the acquisition of new knowledge via processes which are different from those we have been familiar with up to now. This is especially important for teachers' professional development. Faced with this situation, training is seen as the `best way' to guarantee the development of highly productive work environments. The updating of traditional training models is a topic currently undergoing much debate. In the current ever-changing context based on the use of ICTs, the importance of integrating elements of formal, informal and non-formal education is crucial. Another key aspect of the updating of professional training and development is personalization: adapting policies to the specific needs of each individual, according to their style of learning. In this context, it is clear that the use of ICT in education extends the potential learning space for professional development and updating of skills, thereby generating life-long, life-wide, and life-deep learning opportunities. These concepts imply that potential learning spaces are neither developed in a linear fashion nor linked to a specific geographical setting. Each teacher is therefore presented with a wider and more varied range of possibilities from which to create a complex structure of interlinked relations and components which form his own learning ecology: his personal strategy for professional development and relations. The concept of ecology moves beyond Communities of Practice, Personal Learning Environments or Learning Communities and further even than social networks, given that these only exist as selected components of each individual's learning ecology. What is still unanswered is: can learning ecologies really improve those formal systems of life-long learning which have been in use up to now? Is the concept of learning ecologies a valid way to explain and increase levels of personalisation in life-long learning, particularly in teachers' professional development? How can each individual use his/her own learning ecology in order to improve his/her professional activity? Which success factors or strategies need to be identified? What role does ICT play in the setting up of these ecologies? The aim of the research we are going to present is to analyze and understand the ways in which learning ecologies contribute to the professional development of school teachers throughout their lives. In this paper we present the design to conduct this investigation, the mixed methodology we are using and the preliminary results we are getting.","","","10.1109/CICEM.2013.6820171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820171","Learning ecology;teachers' professional development;ICT;lifelong learning;informal learning;online learning;extended spaces for teaching and learning","Environmental factors;Training;Electronic mail;Conferences;Councils;Media","continuing professional development;teacher training","learning ecology;informal professional development opportunities;professional needs;competencies;skills;net society;knowledge acquisition;teacher professional development;productive work environments;training models;ICT;informal education;nonformal education;professional training;personalization;learning style;learning space;life-long learning opportunities;life-wide learning opportunities;life-deep learning opportunities;personal strategy;communities of practice;personal learning environments;learning communities;professional activity;school teachers","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though deep learning is usually limited in static inputs, it provided us a good solution for training neural network with multiple hidden layers. In this paper, we extended process neural network to deep process neural network. Two basic structures of deep process neural network are discussed.

As a consequence, it is indispensable to incorporate corresponding facilities within systems, yielding adequate adaptation behavior to appropriately react on such dynamic changes.

Traditional clustering algorithms, which are commonly employed by unsupervised learning engines, lack the ability to naturally capture temporal dependencies. In supervised learning methods, temporal features are often learned through the use of a feedback (or recurrent) signal. Drawing inspiration from the Elman recurrent neural network, we introduce a winner-take-all based recurrent clustering algorithm that is able to identify temporal regularities in an unsupervised manner. We explore the potential pitfalls that result from adding feedback to an incremental clustering algorithm and apply the proposed technique to several time series inference problems in the context of semi-supervised learning.

We encode those junctions within a range as the same code. To measure the similarity between detected junction string and ground truth junction string, we design a weighted edit distance strategy and assign different deviation with different weight so that our framework is robust enough to deviations in arrow road marking but sensitive to non- arrow road markings' deviations. To test our framework, we collect three freeway datasets with our self-driving car: clean/dirty arrow road marking images (300 images respectively), a video dataset (arrow road marking and non-road marking images (670 images)).

The model of deep Boltzmann machine has been successfully applied to unsupervised learning for single modality (e.g., text, images, video or audio).

For images, most work stays on the stage of manual analyses and has low level of intelligence. Moreover, the sources of data are multiple and its architecture should be scalable since data comes from many platforms and the type of platforms will keep increasing. In this case, existing approaches cannot solve the above problems. Hence comprehensive analysis of images and structured data using deep learning is proposed. Its goal is to extract a unified representation for both images and structured data with massive attributes. In the phase of feature learning, deep restricted Boltzmann machine auto-encoder is used. Through unsupervised learning, more abstract features are extracted and some useless information is removed, which can achieve layered and precise representation. In the phase of supervised training, linear classifier is employed.

To learn features in high-resolution images, we make use of convolutional deep belief networks. Moreover, to take advantage of global structure in an object class, we develop local convolutional restricted Boltzmann machines, a novel convolutional learning model that exploits the global structure by not assuming stationarity of features across the image, while maintaining scalability and robustness to small misalignments.

"A Novel Semi-Supervised Deep Learning Framework for Affective State Recognition on EEG Signals","X. Jia; K. Li; X. Li; A. Zhang","NA; NA; NA; NA","2014 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Bioengineering","","2014","","","30","37","Nowadays the rapid development in the area of human-computer interaction has given birth to a growing interest on detecting different affective states through smart devices. By using the modern sensor equipment, we can easily collect electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, which capture the information from central nervous system and are closely related with our brain activities. Through the training on EEG signals, we can make reasonable analysis on people's affection, which is very promising in various areas. Unfortunately, the special properties of EEG dataset have brought difficulties for conventional machine learning methods. The main reasons lie in two aspects: the small set of labeled samples and the noisy channel problem. To overcome these difficulties and successfully identify the affective states, we come up with a novel semi-supervised deep structured framework. Compared with previous deep learning models, our method is more adapted to the EEG classification problem. We first adopt a two-level procedure, which involves both supervised label information and unsupervised structure information to jointly make decision on channel selection. And then, we add a generative Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model for the classification task, and use the training objectives of generative learning and unsupervised learning to jointly regularize the discriminative training. Finally, we extend it to the active learning scenario, which solves the costly labeling problem. The experiments conducted on real EEG dataset have shown both the convincing result on critical channel selection and the superiority of our method over multiple baselines for the affective state recognition.","","","10.1109/BIBE.2014.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033556","EEG;Deep Belief Network;Channel Selection","Feature extraction;Training;Brain models;Mathematical model;Electroencephalography;Equations","Boltzmann machines;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","semisupervised deep learning framework;affective state recognition;EEG signal;human-computer interaction;smart devices;modern sensor equipment;electroencephalogram signals;central nervous system;brain activities;people affection;conventional machine learning methods;noisy channel problem;semisupervised deep structured framework;deep learning models;EEG classification problem;two-level procedure;supervised label information;unsupervised structure information;generative Restricted Boltzmann Machine model;RBM;classification task;training objectives;generative learning;unsupervised learning;discriminative training;active learning scenario;real EEG dataset;critical channel selection","","21","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Li","Microsoft Research, Redmond; Facebook Corporation","IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing","","2013","21","5","1060","1089","Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has historically been a driving force behind many machine learning (ML) techniques, including the ubiquitously used hidden Markov model, discriminative learning, structured sequence learning, Bayesian learning, and adaptive learning. Moreover, ML can and occasionally does use ASR as a large-scale, realistic application to rigorously test the effectiveness of a given technique, and to inspire new problems arising from the inherently sequential and dynamic nature of speech. On the other hand, even though ASR is available commercially for some applications, it is largely an unsolved problem - for almost all applications, the performance of ASR is not on par with human performance. New insight from modern ML methodology shows great promise to advance the state-of-the-art in ASR technology. This overview article provides readers with an overview of modern ML techniques as utilized in the current and as relevant to future ASR research and systems. The intent is to foster further cross-pollination between the ML and ASR communities than has occurred in the past. The article is organized according to the major ML paradigms that are either popular already or have potential for making significant contributions to ASR technology. The paradigms presented and elaborated in this overview include: generative and discriminative learning; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and active learning; adaptive and multi-task learning; and Bayesian learning. These learning paradigms are motivated and discussed in the context of ASR technology and applications.

Moreover, the generalization capability of DeepID increases as more face classes are to be predicted at training. DeepID features are taken from the last hidden layer neuron activations of deep convolutional networks (ConvNets). When learned as classifiers to recognize about 10, 000 face identities in the training set and configured to keep reducing the neuron numbers along the feature extraction hierarchy, these deep ConvNets gradually form compact identity-related features in the top layers with only a small number of hidden neurons. The proposed features are extracted from various face regions to form complementary and over-complete representations. Any state-of-the-art classifiers can be learned based on these high-level representations for face verification. 97:45% verification accuracy on LFW is achieved with only weakly aligned faces.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909640","face verification;deep learning","Face;Feature extraction;Neurons;Training;Joints;Bayes methods;Biological neural networks","face recognition;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","deep learning face representation;feature representation;deep hidden identity feature;face verification;DeepID;multiclass face identification;training;hidden layer neuron activation;deep convolutional network;face classifier;face identities;feature extraction hierarchy;deep ConvNets;compact identity related feature extraction;complementary representation;overcomplete representation;face verification;LFW","","626","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The insight behind our proposed approach is that an object appearing in different frames of a video clip should share similar features, which can be learned to build better detectors. Unlike many supervised detector adaptation or detection-by-tracking methods, our method does not require any extra annotations or utilize temporal correspondence. We start with the high-confidence detections from a generic detector, then iteratively learn new video-specific features and refine the detection scores. In order to learn discriminative and compact features, we propose a new feature learning method using a deep neural network based on auto en-coders. It differs from the existing unsupervised feature learning methods in two ways: first it optimizes both discriminative and generative properties of the features simultaneously, which gives our features better discriminative ability, second, our learned features are more compact, while the unsupervised feature learning methods usually learn a redundant set of over-complete features.

In this work, we emphasize the similarities between both architectures rather than their differences and we argue that such a unified view allows us to transfer ideas from one domain to the other. As a concrete example we introduce a method for learning a support vector machine classifier with Fisher kernel at the same time as a task-specific data representation. We reinterpret the setting as a multi-layer feed forward network. Its final layer is the classifier, parameterized by a weight vector, and the two previous layers compute Fisher vectors, parameterized by the coefficients of a Gaussian mixture model. We introduce a gradient descent based learning algorithm that, in contrast to other feature learning techniques, is not just derived from intuition or biological analogy, but has a theoretical justification in the framework of statistical learning theory.

The main contribution of this article is the extension of the embedding procedure to both the input and output spaces to easily handle complex outputs. Using this extension, inter-output dependencies can be modelled efficiently. This provides an interesting alternative to probabilistic models such as HMM and CRF.

These relational features are further processed through multiple layers to extract high-level and global features. Multiple groups of ConvNets are constructed in order to achieve robustness and characterize face similarities from different aspects. The top-layer RBM performs inference from complementary high-level features extracted from different ConvNet groups with a two-level average pooling hierarchy.

A variety of hashing methods have been developed, but most of them resort to a single view (representation) of data. However, objects are often described by multiple representations. For instance, images are described by a few different visual descriptors (such as SIFT, GIST, and HOG), so it is desirable to incorporate multiple representations into hashing, leading to multi-view hashing. In this paper we present a deep network for multi-view hashing, referred to as deep multi-view hashing, where each layer of hidden nodes is composed of view-specific and shared hidden nodes, in order to learn individual and shared hidden spaces from multiple views of data. Numerical experiments on image datasets demonstrate the useful behavior of our deep multi-view hashing (DMVH), compared to recently-proposed multi-modal deep network as well as existing shallow models of hashing.","","","10.1109/ICDM.2012.24","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6413830","deep learning;harmonium;hashing;multi-view learning;restricted Boltzmann machines","Binary codes;Training;Visualization;Computational modeling;Hamming distance;Linear programming;Machine learning","cryptography;image coding;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","deep learning;high-dimensional object;similarity-preserving low-dimensional Hamming space;binary code;Hamming distance;hashing method;data single view representation;multiple representation;visual descriptor;multiview hashing;view-specific hidden node;shared hidden node;image dataset","","15","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DBM has been proved to be able to explore underlying manifold knowledge of given objects by appropriately describing highly nonlinear complicated functions with novel training process. Moreover, we also present a novel application of deep learning to feature representations, rather than provide the model input with raw image pixels, we instead utilize the human-engineered descriptors such as Log-Gabor, HoG and Gist, as the source data of deep learning architecture. Finally, we evaluate our deep model on PASCAL VOC2012 benchmark dataset, extensive experiments show that our DBM-based model enables to learn useful hierarchical feature representations from few training samples. Specifically, by feeding the DBM-based deep network with prior-described features such as Log-Gabor, HoG and Gist, we get a significant improvement on performance in comparison with the state-of-art results and the best performance is achieved by using a fusion form of the three descriptors as source material for learning deep model.

There have been recent attempts to introduce automatic systems with the ability to localize, with high accuracy, specific brain regions. These systems usually follow the classical supervised learning paradigm, in which training data from different patients are employed to construct a classifier that is patient-independent. In this paper, we show how by sharing information from different patients, it is possible to increase accuracy for targeting the Subthalamic Nucleus. We do this in the context of multi-task learning, where different but related tasks are used simultaneously to leverage the performance of a learning system. Results show that the multitask framework can outperform the traditional patient-independent scenario in two different real datasets.","","","10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6346927","","Accuracy;Gaussian processes;Support vector machines;Training;Databases;Machine learning;Standards","bioelectric phenomena;brain;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;surgery","multipatient learning;subthalamic nucleus identification;deep brain stimulation;basal ganglia;brain surgeries;Parkinsons disease;specific brain regions;classical supervised learning paradigm;training data;multitask learning;multitask framework;traditional patient-independent scenario","Artificial Intelligence;Deep Brain Stimulation;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Electroencephalography;Humans;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity;Subthalamic Nucleus;Therapy, Computer-Assisted","1","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that by introducing a secondary task (such as shape identification in the object classification task) we are able to significantly improve the performance of the main task for which the model is trained. Using public datasets we evaluated our approach on two image understanding tasks, image segmentation and object classification. On the image segmentation task, we observed that the multi-task model almost doubled the accuracy of segmentation at the pixel-level (from 18.7% to 35.6%) compared to the single task model, and improved the performance of face-detection by 10.2% (from 70.1% to 80.3%). For the object classification task, we observed a 2.1% improvement in classification accuracy (from 91.6% to 93.7%) compared to a single-task model. The proposed multi-task models obtained significantly higher accuracies than previously published results on these datasets, obtaining 22.0% and 6.2% higher accuracies on the face-detection and object classification tasks respectively.

The openness of the network makes the network abound of all kinds of information, so it becomes more and more important that using network text classification techniques enable people to get the information they are interested in quickly from the mixed and disorderly network information. Since network text classification technology is the basis of information filtering, search engines, and other fields, it has gradually become a research focus. The traditional text classification technology can't effectively support the Chinese web page text classification because of the large scale of Chinese web page text. An important way to learn the data feature from massive data is to use deep learning neural network structure. Deep learning network has excellent feature learning ability. It can combine objects of low-level features to form advanced abstract representations of the object which will be more suitable for classification. This paper proposes a new deep learning based text classification model to solve the problem of Chinese web text categorization of dimension reduction.

This work proposes an alternative solution that splits the temporal context into blocks, each learned with a separate deep model. We demonstrate that this approach significantly reduces the number of parameters compared to the classical deep learning procedure, and obtains better results on the TIMIT dataset, among the best of state-of-the-art (with a 20.20% PER).

In the fine-tuning phase, in order to develop good discriminative ability, we stack the RBM networks of each region in deep architecture and combine deep learning with side information constraints in the whole image scale.

However, a major problem with neural networks is that training time becomes prohibitive for very large datasets and the learning algorithm can get stuck in local minima for very deep and wide network architectures. In this paper we examine 3 ways to improve feature learning for audio data using neural networks: 1.using Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) instead of standard sigmoid units; 2.using a powerful regularisation technique called Dropout; 3.using Hessian-Free (HF) optimisation to improve training of sigmoid nets. We show that these methods provide significant improvements in training time and the features learnt are better than state of the art handcrafted features, with a genre classification accuracy of 83 ± 1.1% on the Tzanetakis (GTZAN) dataset.

RBMs are generative models that can learn probability distributions of many different types of data including labeled and unlabeled data sets. Due to the inherent noise of the training data sets, we use an RBM to model statistical distributions of the training data. Furthermore, the learned RBM can be used as a competitive classifier to recognize the keypoints in real-time during the tracking stage, thus making it advantageous to be employed in applications that require real-time performance.

This paper presents a new categorization for concept drift, separating drifts according to different criteria into mutually exclusive and nonheterogeneous categories. Moreover, although ensembles of learning machines have been used to learn in the presence of concept drift, there has been no deep study of why they can be helpful for that and which of their features can contribute or not for that. As diversity is one of these features, we present a diversity analysis in the presence of different types of drifts. We show that, before the drift, ensembles with less diversity obtain lower test errors. On the other hand, it is a good strategy to maintain highly diverse ensembles to obtain lower test errors shortly after the drift independent on the type of drift, even though high diversity is more important for more severe drifts. Longer after the drift, high diversity becomes less important. Diversity by itself can help to reduce the initial increase in error caused by a drift, but does not provide the faster recovery from drifts in long-term.","","","10.1109/TKDE.2009.156","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5156502","Concept drift;online learning;neural network ensembles;diversity.","Machine learning;Testing;Application software;Training data;Information filtering;Industrial training;Neural networks;Time factors;Computer industry;Industrial control","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","online ensemble learning;concept drift;exclusive category;nonheterogeneous category;learning machines;diversity analysis","","207","51","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the process of predicting protein structures, it is essential to accurately assess the quality of generated models.

In this paper, a new approach based on C-a atoms distance matrix and machine learning methods is proposed for single-model QA and the identification of native-like models. Different from existing energy/scoring functions and consensus approaches, this new approach is purely geometry based. Furthermore, a novel algorithm based on deep learning techniques, called DL-Pro, is proposed. For a protein model, DL-Pro uses its distance matrix that contains pairwise distances between two residues' C-a atoms in the model, which sometimes is also called contact map, as an orientation-independent representation. From training examples of distance matrices corresponding to good and bad models, DL-Pro learns a stacked autoencoder network as a classifier.

Specifically, we pre-train a deep neural network in a special unsupervised denoising greedy layer-wise mode, and then fine-tune the whole network in a supervised way by the common back-propagation algorithm. In the pre-training phase, we take the noisy speech signals as the visible layer and try to extract a new feature that minimizes the reconstruction cross-entropy loss between the noisy speech signals and its corresponding clean speech signals. Experimental results show that the proposed DDNN-based VAD not only outperforms the DBN-based VAD but also shows an apparent performance improvement of the deep layers over shallower layers.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6637769","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637769","Deep learning;denoising deep neural networks;voice activity detection","Speech;Noise measurement;Feature extraction;Noise reduction;Noise;Training;Neural networks","backpropagation;belief networks;greedy algorithms;neural nets;signal denoising;speech processing;unsupervised learning","deep layers;DDNN-based VAD;common back-propagation algorithm;special unsupervised denoising greedy layer-wise mode;DDNN based VAD;denoising-deep-neural-network based VAD;shallower layers;state-of-the-art performance;DBN based VAD;deep-belief-networks;voice activity detection;denoising deep neural networks","","18","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We benchmark our method, dubbed Quality of Experience for 3D images through Factored Third Order Restricted Boltzmann Machine (Q3D-RBM), with subjective QoE methods, to determine its accuracy for different types of 3D images.

This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new learning based face representation: the face identity-preserving (FIP) features. Unlike conventional face descriptors, the FIP features can significantly reduce intra-identity variances, while maintaining discriminative ness between identities. Moreover, the FIP features extracted from an image under any pose and illumination can be used to reconstruct its face image in the canonical view. This property makes it possible to improve the performance of traditional descriptors, such as LBP [2] and Gabor [31], which can be extracted from our reconstructed images in the canonical view to eliminate variations. In order to learn the FIP features, we carefully design a deep network that combines the feature extraction layers and the reconstruction layer. The former encodes a face image into the FIP features, while the latter transforms them to an image in the canonical view. Extensive experiments on the large MultiPIE face database [7] demonstrate that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art face recognition methods.","","","10.1109/ICCV.2013.21","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751123","deep learning;face recognition","Face;Lighting;Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Training;Face recognition;Three-dimensional displays","face recognition;feature extraction;image reconstruction;learning (artificial intelligence)","deep learning identity-preserving face space;illumination variations;large pose variations;computer vision;learning based face representation;face identity-preserving feature;FIP feature extraction;face descriptors;intra-identity variance reduction;canonical view;image reconstruction layer;face image encoding;MultiPIE face database;face recognition methods","","148","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments (SPLICE), which is a powerful statistical approach for feature enhancement, models the probabilistic distribution of input noisy features as a mixture of Gaussians. However, soft assignment of an input vector to divided regions is sometimes done inadequately and the vector comes to go through inadequate conversion. Especially when conversion has to be linear, the conversion performance will be easily degraded. Feature enhancement using neural networks is another powerful approach which can directly model a non-linear relationship between noisy and clean feature spaces. In this case, however, it tends to suffer from over-fitting problems. In this paper, we attempt to mitigate this problem by reducing the number of model parameters to estimate. Our neural network is trained whose output layer is associated with the states in the clean feature space, not in the noisy feature space. This strategy makes the size of the output layer independent of the kind of a given noisy environment. Firstly, we characterize the distribution of clean features as a Gaussian mixture model and then, by using deep neural networks, estimate discriminatively the state in the clean space that an input noisy feature corresponds to. Experimental evaluations using the Aurora 2 dataset demonstrate that our proposed method has the best performance compared to conventional methods.","","","10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707755","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707755","Automatic speech recognition;Noise robustness;feature enhancement;Deep learning","Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Speech;Neural networks;Training;Vectors","feature extraction;Gaussian noise;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;neural nets;piecewise linear techniques;speech enhancement;speech recognition;state estimation;statistical analysis;statistical distributions","discriminative piecewise linear transformation;deep learning;noise robust automatic speech recognition;deep neural networks;statistical feature enhancement;stereo-based piecewise linear compensation for environments;SPLICE;statistical approach;probabilistic distribution;input noisy feature;input vector soft assignment;over-fitting problem;parameter estimation;neural network training;clean feature space;noisy feature space;Gaussian mixture model;state estimation;Aurora 2 dataset","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But while such organization is a natural process for humans, quantifying it empirically proves to be a very difficult task, and as such no dominant feature representation for music emotion recognition has yet emerged. Much of the difficulty in developing emotion-based features is the ambiguity of the ground-truth. Even using the smallest time window, opinions on the emotion are bound to vary and reflect some disagreement between listeners. In previous work, we have modeled human response labels to music in the arousal-valence (A-V) representation of affect as a time-varying, stochastic distribution. Current methods for automatic detection of emotion in music seek performance increases by combining several feature domains (e.g. loudness, timbre, harmony, rhythm). Such work has focused largely in dimensionality reduction for minor classification performance gains, but has provided little insight into the relationship between audio and emotional associations. In this new work we seek to employ regression-based deep belief networks to learn features directly from magnitude spectra. While the system is applied to the specific problem of music emotion recognition, it could be easily applied to any regression-based audio feature learning problem.","","","10.1109/ASPAA.2011.6082328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6082328","Emotion recognition;feature learning;regression;deep belief networks","Training;Music;Topology;Emotion recognition;Humans;Machine learning","audio signal processing;belief networks;emotion recognition;music","learning emotion;acoustic features;regression based deep belief networks;expression of emotions;magnitude spectra;music emotion recognition;audio feature learning problem","","35","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study introduces a novel method for discovering coarse structure, using a technique related to LCS, in combination with gradient descent. The structure used is a deep feature network, with a number of properties of a higher level of abstraction than existing ANNs, for example the network is constructed based on co-occurrence relationships, and maintained as a dynamic population of features. The feature creation technique can be considered a coarse or rapid initialization technique, that constructs a network before subsequent fine-tuning using gradient descent. The process is comparable with, but distinct from, layer-wise pretraining methods that construct and initialize a deep network prior to fine-tuning. The approach we introduce is a general learning technique, with assumptions of the dimensionality of input, and the described method uses convolved features. Results of classification of MNIST images show an average error rate of 0.79% without pre-processing or pretraining, comparable to the benchmark result provided by Restricted Boltzmann Machines of 0.95%, and 0.79% using dropout, however based on a convolutional topology, and as such our system is less general than RBM techniques, but more general than existing convolutional systems because it does not require the same domain assumptions and pre-defined topology. Use of a randomly initialized network provides a much poorer result (1.25%) indicating the coarse learning process plays a significant role. Classification of NORB images is examined, with results comparable to SVM approaches. Development of higher level relationships between features using this approach offers a distinct method of learning using a deep network of features, that can be used in combination with existing techniques.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889499","","Sociology;Statistics;Topology;Network topology;Neural networks;Abstracts;Training","evolutionary computation;gradient methods;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;topology","deep networks;evolutionary systems;learning classifier systems;LCS;artificial neural networks;ANNs;coarse structure discovery;gradient descent;deep feature network;cooccurrence relationships;feature creation technique;coarse initialization technique;rapid initialization technique;layer-wise pretraining methods;general learning technique;MNIST image classification;convolutional topology;predefined topology;coarse learning process;NORB image classification","","","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Transfer learning studies on shallow architectures show low performance as they are generally based on hand-crafted features obtained from experts. It is therefore interesting to study transference on deep architectures, known to directly extract the features from the input data. A Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) is a deep model able to represent the hierarchical features needed for solving classification problems. In this paper we study the performance of SDAs trained on one problem and reused to solve a different problem not only with different distribution but also with a different tasks. We propose two different approaches: 1) unsupervised feature transference, and 2) supervised feature transference using deep transfer learning. We show that SDAs using the unsupervised feature transference outperform randomly initialized machines on a new problem. We achieved 7% relative improvement on average error rate and 41% on average computation time to classify typed uppercase letters. In the case of supervised feature transference, we achieved 5.7% relative improvement in the average error rate, by reusing the first and second hidden layer, and 8.5% relative improvement for the average error rate and 54% speed up w.r.t the baseline by reusing all three hidden layers for the same data.

And Deep Learning (DL) models have shown good ability in feature extraction and dimension reduction by constructing multi-layer network. Since the feature extraction in DL can reduce feature dimension while maintain the main information of original inputs, we consider constructing a three layer network which contains input layer, hidden layer and output layer. We use two TWSVMs in the hidden layer to extract features based on the projection principle which is derived from Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The two TWSVMs will get four hyper planes by solving four convex quadratic programs. A new dataset which consists of the extracted features with four feature dimensions is produced from the hidden layer and then we can input it to the main TWSVM of the output layer to make final prediction. Similar as TWSVM, we design linear DTWSVM and nonlinear DTWSVM which have been proved to be very effective in classification problems.

This has many advantages over conventional control systems, including robustness, scope for incremental development and the ability to facilitate accurate pre-prototype simulation. Accelerated learning was achieved by using the robot's intrinsic knowledge of its own symmetry to infer additional information about its surroundings.

In this paper, we explore three natural choices for the secondary task: the phone label, the phone context, and the state context. We demonstrate that, even on a strong baseline, multi-task learning can provide a significant decrease in error rate.

We address the following problems inherent to supervised learning models: 1) the need of a large set of training images; 2) robustness to imaging conditions not present in the training data; and 3) complex search process. The innovations of our approach reside in a formulation that decouples the rigid and nonrigid detections, deep learning methods that model the appearance of the LV, and efficient derivative-based search algorithms. The functionality of our approach is evaluated using a data set of diseased cases containing 400 annotated images (from 12 sequences) and another data set of normal cases comprising 80 annotated images (from two sequences), where both sets present long axis views of the LV. Using several error measures to compute the degree of similarity between the manual and automatic segmentations, we show that our method not only has high sensitivity and specificity but also presents variations with respect to a gold standard (computed from the manual annotations of two experts) within interuser variability on a subset of the diseased cases. We also compare the segmentations produced by our approach and by two state-of-the-art LV segmentation models on the data set of normal cases, and the results show that our approach produces segmentations that are comparable to these two approaches using only 20 training images and increasing the training set to 400 images causes our approach to be generally more accurate. Finally, we show that efficient search methods reduce up to tenfold the complexity of the method while still producing competitive segmentations. In the future, we plan to include a dynamical model to improve the performance of the algorithm, to use semisupervised learning methods to reduce even more the dependence on rich and large training sets, and to design a shape model less dependent on the training set.","","","10.1109/TIP.2011.2169273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6026237","","Training;Image segmentation;Shape;Imaging;Supervised learning;Robustness;Complexity theory","biomedical ultrasonics;cardiology;image segmentation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;search problems;ultrasonic imaging","supervised learning model;automatic segmentation;left ventricle;heart;ultrasound images;complex search process;deep learning methods;derivative based search algorithm;diseased;image annotation;training image;semisupervised learning method;training set","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Heart Ventricles;Humans;Hypertrophy, Left Ventricular;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;ROC Curve;Ventricular Dysfunction, Left","74","59","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover we can accumulate knowledge on meta-learning system development based on it.

Feature hierarchies are discovered considering that higher levels are formed by combining features from lower level. Such a level to level mapping defines our methodology as a deep learning process. The whole analysis can be divided in two major learning steps. The first one regards the Bayesian inference to extract objects and assign basic semantic to the image. The second step models the spatial interactions between the scene objects based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, performing a high level semantic annotation. We used a WorldView2 image to exemplify the processing results.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6334194","Information theory;deep learning;semantic annotation","Semantics;Learning systems;Feature extraction;Communication channels;Visualization;Information representation;Data mining","belief networks;data mining;feature extraction;geophysical image processing;geophysics computing;image resolution;inference mechanisms;remote sensing","image resolution;remote sensing;image information mining;communication channel concept;feature extraction;semantic map;multilevel hierarchical information representation;deep learning;Bayesian inference;spatial interactions;latent Dirichlet allocation;semantic annotation;WorldView2","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They have been widely used to represent various network systems, such as social networks, biological networks and etc. Knowledge discovery on linked data is of great importance to many real applications. One of the major challenges of learning linked data is how to effectively and efficiently extract useful information from both node attributes and links in linked data. Current studies on this topic either use selected topological statistics to represent network structures, or linearly map node attributes and network structures to a shared latent feature space. However, while approaches based on statistics may miss critical patterns in network structure, approaches based on linear mappings may not be sufficient to capture the non-linear characteristics of nodes and links. To handle the challenge, we propose, to our knowledge, the first deep learning method to learn from linked data. A restricted Boltzmann machine model named LRBM is developed for representation learning on linked data. In LRBM, we aim to extract the latent feature representation of each node from both node attributes and network structures, non-linearly map each pair of nodes to the links, and use hidden units to control the mapping. The details of how to adapt LRBM for link prediction and node classification on linked data have also been presented. In the experiments, we test the performance of LRBM as well as other baselines on link prediction and node classification. Overall, the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed LRBM model in mining linked data.","","","10.1109/ICDM.2014.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7023347","Deep Learning;Linked Data;Restricted Boltzmann Machine;Representation Learning","Data models;Tensile stress;Receivers;Data mining;Feature extraction;Probability distribution;Social network services","Boltzmann machines;data mining;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","LRBM;restricted Boltzmann machine model;representation learning;Linked Data mining;knowledge discovery;deep learning method;latent feature representation","","5","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a novel face parser, which recasts segmentation of face components as a cross-modality data transformation problem, i.e., transforming an image patch to a label map. Specifically, a face is represented hierarchically by parts, components, and pixel-wise labels. With this representation, our approach first detects faces at both the part- and component-levels, and then computes the pixel-wise label maps (Fig.1). Our part-based and component-based detectors are generatively trained with the deep belief network (DBN), and are discriminatively tuned by logistic regression. The segmentators transform the detected face components to label maps, which are obtained by learning a highly nonlinear mapping with the deep autoencoder. The proposed hierarchical face parsing is not only robust to partial occlusions but also provide richer information for face analysis and face synthesis compared with face keypoint detection and face alignment. The effectiveness of our algorithm is shown through several tasks on 2, 239 images selected from three datasets (e.g., LFW [12], BioID [13] and CUFSF [29]).","","","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247963","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247963","","Face;Detectors;Image segmentation;Shape;Training;Logistics;Robustness","belief networks;face recognition;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);object detection;regression analysis","hierarchical face parsing;deep learning;facial component parsing;face images;face parser;face component segmentation;cross-modality data transformation problem;image patch transformation;face detection;pixel-wise label maps;part-based detectors;component-based detectors;deep belief network;DBN;logistic regression;nonlinear mapping learning;deep autoencoder;face analysis;face synthesis;face keypoint detection;face alignment","","16","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SOM is known as one of the effective methods to extract the principle feature from many parameters and decrease the dimension of parameters. Through the competitive learning algorithms, the obtained map is tuned to express specific features of the input signals. We have been investigating the possibility of navigation system based on SOM through simulations are experiments with an AUV called ""Twin-Burger"". The learning algorithm of usual SOM is unsupervised learning. However, supervised learning algorithms should be introduced because the relationship between distances information and desirable behavior of the robot, that is, the relationship from inputs to outputs should be acquired and learned. In this paper, a supervised learning algorithm is introduced into SOM and a method to adapt the local map to its environment by learning and evaluating the trajectory of robot is proposed. In the proposed method, the ""initial map"" is made static and digital value as teaching data. In order to include more information of environment in the initial map, the trajectories of robot are evaluated, and the evaluation is utilized in the learning process. This method enables the map to have both the effect of dynamics of robot and environmental information.

The face parsing detectors are trained via deep belief network and tuned by logistic regression. The detectors first detect face, and then detect nose, eyes and mouth hierarchically. A deep architecture pretrained with stacked autoencoder is applied to facial expression recognition with the concentrated features of detected components. The parsing components remove the redundant information in expression recognition, and images don't need to be aligned or any other artificial treatment.

In this paper, we present a novel framework to learn sparse representations via a generalized encoder-decoder architecture. The basic idea is to adopt a fast approximation to the iterative sparse coding solution and form an efficient nonlinear encoder to map an input to a sparse representation. A set of basis functions is then learned through the minimization of an energy function consisting of a sparseness prior and linear decoder constraints. Applying a greedy layer-wise learning scheme, this framework can be extended to more layers to learn deep networks. The proposed learning algorithm is also highly efficient as no iterative operations are required, and both batch and on-line learning are supported. Given the sparse representation and basis functions, an optimized decoding procedure is carried out to reconstruct and denoise the input signals. We evaluate our model on natural image patches to develop a dictionary of V1-like Gabor filters, and further show that basis functions in a higher layer (e.g., V2) combine the filters in a lower layer to generate more complex patterns to benefit the high-level tasks. We then use the sparse representations to recognize objects in two benchmark data sets (i.e., CIFAR-10 and NORB) via a linear SVM classifier, and demonstrate better or comparable recognition performances with respect to state-of-art algorithms. The image reconstruction of MNIST images and the restoration of corrupted versions are presented at the end.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252810","","Dictionaries;Decoding;Vectors;Iterative decoding;Encoding;Image reconstruction;Matrix decomposition","decoding;Gabor filters;image coding;image representation;image restoration;iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);minimisation;pattern classification;signal denoising;support vector machines","learning sparse representation;nonlinear shrinkage encoder;linear sparse decoder;research interest;generalized encoder-decoder architecture;iterative sparse coding solution;nonlinear encoder;basis functions;minimization;energy function;sparseness prior decoder constraints;sparseness linear decoder constraints;greedy layer-wise learning scheme;deep networks;learning algorithm;iterative operations;batch learning;online learning;optimized decoding procedure;signal reconstruction;signal denoising;natural image patches;dictionary;V1-like Gabor filters;complex patterns;sparse representations;benchmark data sets;linear SVM classifier;recognition performances;state-of-art algorithms;image reconstruction;MNIST images;corrupted versions restoration","","1","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep-Sense includes two switchable feature learning approaches. DeepSense exploits a temporal-spatial deep learning approach for traffic flow prediction with the sufficient spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces in dynamic pattern. Meanwhile, Deep-Sense takes advantage of a supplementary temporal sequence segment matching approach with the temporal transformation of traffic flow state for a given road segment when there are not enough traffic traces.

In this study we apply DBNs to a natural language understanding problem. The recent surge of activity in this area was largely spurred by the development of a greedy layer-wise pretraining method that uses an efficient learning algorithm called Contrastive Divergence (CD). CD allows DBNs to learn a multi-layer generative model from unlabeled data and the features discovered by this model are then used to initialize a feed-forward neural network which is fine-tuned with backpropagation. We compare a DBN-initialized neural network to three widely used text classification algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), boosting and Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt). The plain DBN-based model gives a call-routing classification accuracy that is equal to the best of the other models. However, using additional unlabeled data for DBN pre-training and combining DBN-based learned features with the original features provides significant gains over SVMs, which, in turn, performed better than both MaxEnt and Boosting.","","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2303296","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6737243","Call-Routing;DBN;Deep Learning;Deep Neural Nets;Natural language Understanding;RBM","Training;Vectors;Support vector machines;Boosting;Speech;Speech processing;Hidden Markov models","belief networks;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;speech recognition","deep belief network application;natural language understanding;DBN;image classification;speech recognition;audio classification;learning algorithm;contrastive divergence;CD;feedforward neural network;support vector machines;SVM;maximum entropy;MaxEnt","","161","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Selecting the best tile size for a given architecture and compiler is known as Optimal Tile Size Selection Problem. It is a NP-hard problem. People have build cost models for this problem that characterize the performance of a program as a function of tile sizes. The best tile size for a given loop is determined directly by using these models. Hand crafting an accurate tile size selection cost model is hard. Can we automatically learn a tile size selection model? This is an important question. In this paper, we have shown that a fairly accurate model can be learned using simple program dynamic features with standard machine learning techniques.

Behind the success of deep learning, there is much space for improvement. It is difficult to identify if a testing sample can be represented by the deep network effectively before we examining the final result. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic boosting strategy according to reconstruction error in deep networks. We use reconstruction error to determine whether the result is reliable or not. From the perspective of prediction interval, we demonstrated that with the increase of reconstruction error, the prediction interval would become bigger. Therefore, the classification result is not reliable when the reconstruction error exceeds the predetermined threshold. Since we can record the reconstruction error as well as the classification error for all training samples in training set. We can learn an extra boosting model besides the deep network in training set to improve the performance of the model. An important factor in learning the boosting model is to determine an appropriate threshold for selecting training samples. In testing, we first examine whether the reconstruction error of a testing sample exceeds the threshold to determine if we should use the boosting model. If the boosting model is used, the final result is the average of the output of the deep network and the boosting model. We conducted experiments on two widely used classification datasets and an air quality dataset. From the experiments, we see that our boosting strategy is effective in improving the performance of classification. We tested several boosting models in this paper. They can all reduce the test error to some extent under appropriate parameter settings.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889534","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889534","","Boosting;Training;Image reconstruction;Testing;Neural networks;Vectors;Reliability","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","parameter settings;classification performance;air quality dataset;boosting model;training samples;classification error;deep networks;dynamic boosting strategy;reconstruction error;deep learning","","2","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this approach will potentially enable us to use the model as one component of a larger deep architecture. This will allow us to use the feature information in an ordinary deep network to perform better modeling of transformations, and to infer pose estimates from the hidden representation. We focus on applying these higher-order Boltzmann machines to the NORB 3D objects data set and the Labeled Faces in the Wild face data set. We first show two different approaches to using this method on these object classes, demonstrating that while some useful transformation information can be extracted, ultimately the simple direct application of these models to higher-resolution, complex object classes is insufficient to achieve improved visual verification performance.

However, DNNs are usually optimized with the minimum cross entropy criterion. In contrast to most conventional classification methods, our proposed approach can be formulated to embed DNNs and MAP into the objective function to be optimized during training.

Some of them use network traffic history to achieve more flexibility and prediction ability while others use algorithms such as fuzzy logic to address scalability problem and high input load. Our proposed approach benefits from both: Using fuzzy logic to deal with high input load and embedding expert knowledge into the algorithm while optimizing router decisions with reinforcement learning fed by network traffic history.

In this paper, we have proposed a general adaptation scheme for DNN based on discriminant condition codes, which are directly fed to various layers of a pre-trained DNN through a new set of connection weights. Moreover, we present several training methods to learn connection weights from training data as well as the corresponding adaptation methods to learn new condition code from adaptation data for each new test condition. In this work, the fast adaptation scheme is applied to supervised speaker adaptation in speech recognition based on either frame-level cross-entropy or sequence-level maximum mutual information training criterion. We have proposed three different ways to apply this adaptation scheme based on the so-called speaker codes: i) Nonlinear feature normalization in feature space; ii) Direct model adaptation of DNN based on speaker codes; iii) Joint speaker adaptive training with speaker codes. We have evaluated the proposed adaptation methods in two standard speech recognition tasks, namely TIMIT phone recognition and large vocabulary speech recognition in the Switchboard task. Experimental results have shown that all three methods are quite effective to adapt large DNN models using only a small amount of adaptation data. For example, the Switchboard results have shown that the proposed speaker-code-based adaptation methods may achieve up to 8-10% relative error reduction using only a few dozens of adaptation utterances per speaker. Finally, we have achieved very good performance in Switchboard (12.1% in WER) after speaker adaptation using sequence training criterion, which is very close to the best performance reported in this task (“Deep convolutional neural networks for LVCSR,” T.

Because of poor understanding of the mechanism and influence factors of rockburst, it is very difficult to give accurate prediction using conventional methods. A new model based on Gaussian process (GP), which is a probabilistic kernel machine leaning and has become a power tool for solving highly nonlinear problems, therefore, is proposed. At first, case histories of rockburst occurrence with the real records of rockburst intensity and influence factors of rockburst are collected and are taken as prior knowledge to be learned by GP binary classification machine learning tech, where, maximum tangential stress in surround rockmass, uniaxial compressive strength, tensile strength of rock, and rockburst tendency index of rock, which can reflect the internal and exterior conditions of rockburst occurrence nicely are suggested to be main influential factors of rockburst. Then, the nonlinear mapping relationship between rockburst intensity and its influence factors can be established easily by GP model. Finally, prediction for the novel conditions in deep mines can be obtained using the model. The new model is applied in prediction for rockburst intensity at practical projects in China, Norway and USSR.

In fact, experimental results and heuristic considerations suggest that deep architectures are more suitable than shallow ones for modern applications, facing very complex problems, e.g., vision and human language understanding. However, the actual theoretical results supporting such a claim are still few and incomplete. In this paper, we propose a new approach to study how the depth of feedforward neural networks impacts on their ability in implementing high complexity functions. First, a new measure based on topological concepts is introduced, aimed at evaluating the complexity of the function implemented by a neural network, used for classification purposes. Then, deep and shallow neural architectures with common sigmoidal activation functions are compared, by deriving upper and lower bounds on their complexity, and studying how the complexity depends on the number of hidden units and the used activation function. The obtained results seem to support the idea that deep networks actually implements functions of higher complexity, so that they are able, with the same number of resources, to address more difficult problems.","","","10.1109/TNNLS.2013.2293637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6697897","Betti numbers;deep neural networks;function approximation;topological complexity;Vapnik--Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dim).;Betti numbers;deep neural networks;function approximation;topological complexity;Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension (VC-dim)","Complexity theory;Neurons;Biological neural networks;Polynomials;Upper bound;Computer architecture","computational complexity;feedforward neural nets;pattern classification;topology","neural network classifiers;shallow architecture;deep architecture;artificial neural network;hidden layers;vision;human language understanding;feedforward neural network;high complexity functions;topological concepts;function complexity evaluation;classification;sigmoidal activation function;deep network","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Models, Theoretical;Nerve Net;Pattern Recognition, Automated","119","54","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our main goal was to study how the performance of knowledge transfer between such problems would be affected by varying the number of layers being retrained and the amount of data used in that retraining. Generally, reusing networks trained for a different label set led to better results than reusing networks trained for a different data distribution. In particular, reusing for less classes a network trained for more classes was beneficial for virtually any amount of training data. In all cases, retraining only one layer to save time consistently led to poorer performance.

We propose a noisy training approach to tackle this problem: by injecting noises into the training speech intentionally and randomly, more generalizable DNN models can be learned. This `noise injection' technique has been well-known to the neural computation community, however there is little knowledge if it would work for the DNN model which involves a highly complex objective function.

Typically, deep neural networks are trained based on the cross-entropy criterion using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, plain SGD requires scanning the whole training set many passes before reaching the asymptotic region, making it difficult to scale to large dataset. It has been established that the second order SGD can potentially reach its asymptotic region in one pass through the training dataset. However, since it involves expensive computing for the inverse of Hessian matrix in the loss function, its application is limited. Averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is proved simple and effective for one pass online learning. This paper investigates the ASGD algorithm for deep neural network training. We tested ASGD on the Mandarin Chinese record speech recognition task using deep neural networks. Experimental results show that the performance of one pass ASGD is very close to that of multiple passes SGD.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854928","deep neural network;speech recognition;averaged stochastic gradient descent;one pass learning","Training;Stochastic processes;Optimization;Speech recognition;Schedules;Acoustics;Neural networks","acoustic signal processing;entropy;Gaussian processes;Hessian matrices;mixture models;neural nets;speech recognition;telecommunication computing","one pass learning;deep neural network training;averaged stochastic gradient descent;ASGD;acoustic models;Gaussian mixture models;G-MM;cross-entropy criterion;asymptotic region;training dataset;expensive computing;inverse Hessian matrix;Mandarin Chinese record speech recognition task","","4","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Generally, the sequential implementation of both RBMs and backpropagation algorithm takes significant amount of computational time to process massive data sets. The emerging big data learning requires distributed computing for the DBNs. In this paper, we present a distributed learning paradigm for the RBMs and the backpropagation algorithm using MapReduce, a popular parallel programming model. Thus, the DBNs can be trained in a distributed way by stacking a series of distributed RBMs for pretraining and a distributed backpropagation for fine-tuning.

A learning algorithm for the T-DSN's weight matrices and tensors is developed and described in which the main parameter estimation burden is shifted to a convex subproblem with a closed-form solution. Using an efficient and scalable parallel implementation for CPU clusters, we train sets of T-DSNs in three popular tasks in increasing order of the data size: handwritten digit recognition using MNIST (60k), isolated state/phone classification and continuous phone recognition using TIMIT (1.1 m), and isolated phone classification using WSJ0 (5.2 m). Experimental results in all three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the T-DSN and the associated learning methods in a consistent manner. In particular, a sufficient depth of the T-DSN, a symmetry in the two hidden layers structure in each T-DSN block, our model parameter learning algorithm, and a softmax layer on top of T-DSN are shown to have all contributed to the low error rates observed in the experiments for all three tasks.","","","10.1109/TPAMI.2012.268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6389679","Deep learning;stacking networks;tensor;bilinear models;handwriting image classification;phone classification and recognition;MNIST;TIMIT;WSJ","Computer architecture;Training;Tensile stress;Vectors;Stacking;Machine learning;Closed-form solutions","convex programming;handwritten character recognition;higher order statistics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;parameter estimation;pattern classification;tensors","tensor deep stacking networks;bilinear mapping;weight tensor;higher-order statistics;hidden binary features;T-DSN weight matrices;parameter estimation;convex subproblem;closed-form solution;parallel implementation;CPU clusters","","70","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Meanwhile, the analogous situation in automated face recognition, where a large number of training examples of an individual are available, has been largely underexplored, in spite of the increasing relevance of this setting in the age of social media. Inspired by these observations, we propose to explicitly learn enhanced face representations on a per-individual basis, and we present two methods enabling this approach. By learning and operating within person-specific representations, we are able to significantly outperform the previous state-of-the-art on PubFig83, a challenging benchmark for familiar face recognition in the wild, using a novel method for learning representations in deep visual hierarchies.

In this paper, we present a deep neural architecture to explore speaker-specific characteristics from popular Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients. For learning, we propose an objective function consisting of contrastive cost in terms of speaker similarity and dissimilarity as well as data reconstruction cost used as regularization to normalize non-speaker related information.

In such scenarios, policy learning is subject to the curse of dimensionality, leading to scaling problems for traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL). To address this, the agent has to efficiently acquire and reuse latent knowledge. One way is through Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), which embellishes RL with a hierarchical, model-based approach to state, reward and policy representation. This paper presents a novel learning approach for HRL based on Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (CRBMs). The proposed model provides a uniform means to simultaneously learn policies and associated abstract state features, and allows learning and executing hierarchical skills within a consistent, uniform network structure. In this model, learning is performed incrementally from basic grounded features to complex abstract policies based on automatically extracted latent states and rewards.","","","10.1109/SMC.2013.424","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6722177","","Abstracts;Learning (artificial intelligence);Context;Vectors;Buildings;Computational modeling;Training","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;learning (artificial intelligence)","intelligent agents;CRBM;conditional restricted Boltzmann machines;HRL;hierarchical reinforcement learning policy modeling;deep belief network","","","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking advantage of the frame correlation, we design an unsupervised sequence model as a pseudo auxiliary task to capture the underlying information from both the labeled and unlabeled data. The knowledge learnt by the auxiliary task can be transferred to the main task of CRF with a deep architecture by sharing the hidden layers, which is very helpful for learning meaningful representation and reducing the need of labeled data.

So far there has been a great deal of literature on unsupervised feature learning and joint training of deep learning. There is little specific guidance, however, on combining hand-designed features or the operations on them with features which are learned from unsupervised learning. In this paper, using MNIST (“Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology”) handwritten digit database as an example, we propose a novel method for training sparse auto-encoders. In this method, we first get some small-scale features through training, then generate more features through operations such as rotation and translation. Finally, we use the whole dataset to fine-tune the network. This approach avoids optimizing cost function for all nodes in the traditional sparse auto-encoder training process, which is very time-consuming. Simulation results show that the proposed method can speed up the training process by over 50%, while keeping the recognition accuracy at the same level or even better. The present findings also contribute to the field's understanding of sparse representation that large-scale sparse features can be generated by small-scale sparse features.","","","10.1109/CISP.2013.6745205","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6745205","representation learning;feature learning;unsupervised learning;sparse auto-encoders;neural network","Training;Accuracy;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Educational institutions;Joints;Unsupervised learning","handwriting recognition;image representation;unsupervised learning","novel efficient method;sparse auto-encoders;machine learning algorithms;data representation;unsupervised feature learning;deep learning;hand-designed features;MNIST handwritten digit database","","3","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Number of training samples are generally limited in case of handwritten scripts ruling out the first option. Therefore, in this work we propose a method to represent data in a more informative manner that enables learning algorithm to approximate the actual target function despite limited training data samples.

In this paper, we propose a novel technique to split a DNN into language-independent and -dependent sub-networks using multi-lingual speech training data. Our basic assumption is that, in a DNN for speech processing, language-independent feature processing is done in stages that are near to the input layer, while language-dependent processing is performed in stages that are near to the output layer. Based on this assumption, we propose a technique to simultaneously optimize multiple sub-networks in a DNN trained with multi-lingual speech data. The language-dependent and -independent processing boundaries in individual sub-networks are segmented automatically. We test our technique in phoneme classification experiments. The results demonstrate that a language-independent sub-network DNN extracted by our technique can be used as a universal network for speech processing of additional new languages.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639092","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6639092","Speech Recognition;Deep Neural Network;Restricted Boltzmann Machine","Speech;Training;Neurons;Acoustics;Neural networks;Speech recognition;Speech processing","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern classification;speech recognition","automatic localization;language-independent subnetwork feature processing;deep neural network training;DNN;automatic speech recognition;ASR;language-dependent subnetwork feature processing;multilingual speech training data;speech processing;phoneme classification experiment","","2","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Keynote addresses: From auditory masking to binary classification: Machine learning for speech separation","D. Wang","Ohio State University, USA","2013 IEEE Workshop on Applications of Signal Processing to Audio and Acoustics","","2013","","","1","1","Summary form only given. Speech separation, or the cocktail party problem, is a widely acknowledged challenge. Part of the challenge stems from the confusion of what the computational goal should be. While the separation of every sound source in a mixture is considered the gold standard, I argue that such an objective is neither realistic nor what the human auditory system does. Motivated by the auditory masking phenomenon, we have suggested instead the ideal time-frequency binary mask as a main goal for computational auditory scene analysis. This leads to a new formulation to speech separation that classifies time-frequency units into two classes: those dominated by the target speech and the rest. In supervised learning, a paramount issue is generalization to conditions unseen during training. I describe novel methods to deal with the generalization issue where support vector machines (SVMs) are used to estimate the ideal binary mask. One method employs distribution fitting to adapt to unseen signal-to-noise ratios and iterative voice activity detection to adapt to unseen noises. Another method learns more linearly separable features using deep neural networks (DNNs) and then couples DNN and linear SVM for training on a variety of noisy conditions. Systematic evaluations show high quality separation in new acoustic environments.","","","10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701900","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701900","","Educational institutions;Speech;Biological neural networks;Awards activities;Conferences;Acoustics;Speech processing","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;signal classification;signal detection;source separation;speech processing;support vector machines;time-frequency analysis","binary classification;machine learning;speech separation;sound source separation;human auditory system;auditory masking phenomenon;ideal time-frequency binary mask estimation;computational auditory scene analysis;time-frequency unit classification;supervised learning;support vector machines;signal-to-noise ratio;deep neural networks;DNNs;linear SVM;acoustic environments;systematic evaluations;cocktail party problem;iterative voice activity detection;distribution fitting","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm first learns a model of the multi-objective sequential decision making problem, after which this learned model is used by a multi-objective dynamic programming method to compute Pareto optimal policies. The advantage of this model-based multi-objective reinforcement learning method is that once an accurate model has been estimated from the experiences of an agent in some environment, the dynamic programming method will compute all Pareto optimal policies. Therefore it is important that the agent explores the environment in an intelligent way by using a good exploration strategy. In this paper we have supplied the agent with two different exploration strategies and compare their effectiveness in estimating accurate models within a reasonable amount of time. The experimental results show that our method with the best exploration strategy is able to quickly learn all Pareto optimal policies for the Deep Sea Treasure problem.","","","10.1109/ADPRL.2014.7010622","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7010622","","Computational modeling;Pareto optimization;Learning (artificial intelligence);Heuristic algorithms;Dynamic programming;Vectors;Markov processes","decision making;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);Pareto optimisation","model-based multiobjective reinforcement learning;multiobjective sequential decision making problem;multiobjective dynamic programming method;Pareto optimal policies;deep sea treasure problem","","9","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the conventional video representation methods extract each modality ineffectively, we propose a regularized multi-modality deep learning for video event detection. We first build an auto-encoder based on unconstrained minimization and adopt the conjugate gradient method with linear search for optimization. The learned auto-encoder can capture the relationship between the audio and visual modality corresponding to the same video event at each layer of the network. To make the network robust to local variance, we adopt the commonly used local contrast normalization and spatial maximum pooling to each modality for video representation. Compared with traditional methods using manually designed features, our method is more efficient. Experimental results on publicly available video event detection datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art video representation methods.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976835","","Visualization;Feature extraction;Event detection;Neural networks;Training;Unsupervised learning;Image reconstruction","audio-visual systems;conjugate gradient methods;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;minimisation;search problems;video retrieval;video signal processing","complex video event detection;spatial maximum pooling;local contrast normalization;local variance robustness;audio modality;visual modality;optimization;linear search;conjugate gradient method;unconstrained minimization;auto-encoder;regularized multimodality deep learning;video representation methods","","6","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

DSNs do not have recurrent connections, making them less effective to model and classify input data with temporal dependencies. In this paper, we embed recurrent connections into the DSN, giving rise to Recurrent Deep Stacking Networks (R-DSNs). Each module of the R-DSN consists of a special form of recurrent neural networks. Generalizing from the earlier DSN, the use of linearity in the output units of the R-DSN enables us to derive a closed form for computing the gradient of the cost function with respect to all network matrices without backpropagating errors. Each module in the R-DSN is initialized with an echo state network, where the input and recurrent weights are fixed to have the echo state property. Then all connection weights within the module are fine tuned using batch-mode gradient descent where the gradient takes an analytical form. Experiments are performed on the TIMIT dataset for frame-level phone state classification with 183 classes. The results show that the R-DSN gives higher classification accuracy over a single recurrent neural network without stacking.","","","10.1109/ChinaSIP.2014.6889295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889295","Recurrent Neural Network;Stacking;Deep Learning;Sequence Classification","Cost function;Training;Abstracts;Silicon;Field-flow fractionation;Equations;Mathematical model","feedforward neural nets;gradient methods;matrix algebra;pattern classification;recurrent neural nets","recurrent deep-stacking networks;sequence classification;shallow feedforward neural network stacking;concatenated features;raw input data;input data classification;temporal dependencies;R-DSNs;cost function;network matrices;echo state network;recurrent weights;batch-mode gradient descent;analytical form;TIMIT dataset;frame-level phone state classification;single recurrent neural network","","4","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among that a large part comprises of online subject-specific databases, hidden behind query interface forms known as deep web. Existing search engines are unable to completely index this highly relevant information due to its large volume. To access deep web content, the research community has proposed to organize it using machine learning techniques. Clustering is one of the key solutions to organize the deep web databases. Existing clustering methods do not encounter semantic relevance among deep web forms. In this paper, we propose a novel method DWSemClust to cluster deep web databases based on the semantic relevance found among deep web forms by employing a generative probabilistic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for modeling content representative of deep web databases. A document comprises of multiple topics, the task of LDA is to cluster words present in the document into ""topics"". The purpose of the parameter estimation process in the underlying model is to discover the document's topic and tell about its proportionate distribution in documents. Deep web has a sparse topic distribution. Due to this reason we have proposed to use LDA that is supposed to be a good clustering solution for the sparse distribution of topics. Further we employ a rich set of metadata as our content representative that comprises of form contents (single attribute/ multiple attributes) and page contents. Experimental results show that our proposed method clearly outperforms the existing non-semantics based clustering methods.","","","10.1109/INCoS.2013.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6630398","Latent Dirichlet Allocation;Deep Web Mining;Soft Clustering;Topic Models;Semantics","Semantics;Entropy;Databases;Clustering algorithms;Resource management;Web sites;Vocabulary","Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);meta data;pattern clustering;statistical analysis","latent Dirichlet allocation;semantic clustering;heterogeneous deep Web sources;query interface form;search engines;machine learning techniques;deep Web database;semantic relevance;DWSemClust method;parameter estimation process;sparse topic distribution;meta data;form contents;page contents","","2","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After extracting low-dimensional features by using the deep sparse auto encoder, we employ random forests to classify low-dimensional features representing human motion. In experiments, we compared using the row data and three types of feature extraction methods - principal component analysis, a shallow sparse auto encoder, and a deep sparse auto encoder - for pattern recognition. The experimental results show that the deep sparse auto encoder outperformed the other methods with the highest average recognition accuracy, 75.1%, and the lowest standard deviation, ±3.30%.

Also, all the previous approaches have not addressed the issue of how to make use of extra unsupervised data. This paper proposes a novel feature engineering approach within the deep learning framework for speaker verification. Hidden layer output of deep neural network or deep belief network trained on large amount of speech recognition data are extracted as deep features. These features are then used in a Tandem fashion or concatenated with the original acoustic features for GMM-UBM speaker verification. The proposed approach can make use of large amount of existing speech recognition data without speaker labels and is easy to be combined with other mature classification approaches. Experiments on the core condition of NIST 2006 SRE showed that, in a text independent task, the proposed approach can achieve 12.8% relative EER improvement compared to the standard GMM-UBM systems.

Those parameters determine the effectivity and efficiency of an algorithm and their impact is usually well known. There are however further non-algorithmic impact factors (or hidden parameters), which bias the training of a machine learning system as well as the subsequent detection process and thus need to be well understood and taken into account. In the context of megafauna detection in benthic images, we investigate the effects of some of these parameters on our machine learning based detection system iSIS. The images to be analyzed were taken at the deep-sea, long-term observatory HAUSGARTEN in which five experts labeled seven distinct object classes as an annotation gold standard. We found, that the hidden parameters from imaging as well as the fusion of expert knowledge could partly be compensated and were able to achieve detection performances of 0.67 precision and 0.87 recall.

The deep learning model demonstrates strong power in learning hierarchical features which greatly facilitates the recognition mission. We apply the Max-pooling Convolutional Neural Network (MPCNN), one of the most popular deep learning models, in this system, and assign different poses of objects as different classes in MPCNN. Besides, a new object detection method is also presented to overcome the disadvantage of the deep learning model. We have built a database comprised of 5 objects with different poses and illuminations for experimental performance evaluation.

Recently, the machine-learning-based VADs have shown a superiority to traditional VADs on multiple feature fusion tasks. However, existing machine-learning-based VADs only utilize shallow models, which cannot explore the underlying manifold of the features. In this paper, we propose to fuse multiple features via a deep model, called deep belief network (DBN). DBN is a powerful hierarchical generative model for feature extraction. It can describe highly variant functions and discover the manifold of the features. We take the multiple serially-concatenated features as the input layer of DBN, and then extract a new feature by transferring these features through multiple nonlinear hidden layers. Finally, we predict the class of the new feature by a linear classifier. We further analyze that even a single-hidden-layer-based belief network is as powerful as the state-of-the-art models in the machine-learning-based VADs. In our empirical comparison, ten common features are used for performance analysis. Extensive experimental results on the AURORA2 corpus show that the DBN-based VAD not only outperforms eleven referenced VADs, but also can meet the real-time detection demand of VAD. The results also show that the DBN-based VAD can fuse the advantages of multiple features effectively.","","","10.1109/TASL.2012.2229986","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6362186","Deep learning;information fusion;voice activity detection","Acoustics;Feature extraction;Training;Speech;Fuses;Speech processing;Support vector machines","acoustic signal detection;belief networks;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);sensor fusion;signal classification;speech processing","deep belief network;voice activity detection;acoustic feature;machine-learning-based VAD;feature fusion;DBN;feature extraction;feature manifold;nonlinear hidden layer;linear classifier;single-hidden-layer-based belief network;AURORA2 corpus","","124","74","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, the proposed JELSR joins embedding learning with sparse regression to perform feature selection. To show the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we also provide a method using the weight via local linear approximation and adding the ℓ2,1-norm regularization, and design an effective algorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem. Furthermore, we also conduct some insightful discussion on the proposed feature selection approach, including the convergence analysis, computational complexity, and parameter determination. In all, the proposed framework not only provides a new perspective to view traditional methods but also evokes some other deep researches for feature selection.

Typically, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the most popular method for training deep neural networks. However, training DNN with minibatch based SGD is very slow. Because it requires frequent serial training and scanning the whole training set many passes before reaching the asymptotic region, making it difficult to scale to large dataset. Commonly, we can reduce training time from two aspects, reducing the epochs of training and exploring the distributed training algorithm. There are some distributed training algorithms, such as LBFGS, Hessian-free optimization and asynchronous SGD, have proven significantly reducing the training time. In order to further reduce the training time, we attempted to explore training algorithm with fast convergence and combined it with distributed training algorithm. Averaged stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) is proved simple and effective for one pass on-line learning. This paper investigates the asynchronous ASGD algorithm for deep neural network training. We tested asynchronous ASGD on the Mandarin Chinese recorded speech recognition task using deep neural networks. Experimental results show that the performance of one pass asynchronous ASGD is very close to that of multiple passes asynchronous SGD. Meanwhile, we can reduce the training time by a factor of 6.3.","","","10.1109/ISCSLP.2014.6936596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936596","deep neural network;speech recognition;Asynchronous averaged SGD;one pass learning","Training;Stochastic processes;Optimization;Speech recognition;Neural networks;Speech;Acoustics","gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","network training time;asynchronous averaged stochastic gradient descent;Gaussian mixture model;GMM;deep neural network acoustic models;SGD method;minibatch based SGD;LBFGS algorithm;Hessian-free optimization algorithm;asynchronous SGD algorithm;one pass online learning;Mandarin Chinese recorded speech recognition task","","5","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies discover that there are no universally best hand-engineered features for all datasets, and learning features directly from the data may be more advantageous. One such endeavor is Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) proposed by Wiskott and Sejnowski [33]. SFA can learn the invariant and slowly varying features from input signals and has been proved to be valuable in human action recognition [34]. It is also observed that the multi-layer feature representation has succeeded remarkably in widespread machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose to combine SFA with deep learning techniques to learn hierarchical representations from the video data itself. Specifically, we use a two-layered SFA learning structure with 3D convolution and max pooling operations to scale up the method to large inputs and capture abstract and structural features from the video. Thus, the proposed method is suitable for action recognition. At the same time, sharing the same merits of deep learning, the proposed method is generic and fully automated. Our classification results on Hollywood2, KTH and UCF Sports are competitive with previously published results. To highlight some, on the KTH dataset, our recognition rate shows approximately 1% improvement in comparison to state-of-the-art methods even without supervision or dense sampling.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909732","deep learning;slow feature analysis;action recognition","Feature extraction;Kernel;Convolution;Video sequences;Abstracts;Three-dimensional displays;Visualization","convolution;feature extraction;image recognition;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","deeply-learned slow feature analysis;DL-SFA;video action recognition;complex hand-designed local features;sensor modalities;invariant features;slowly varying features;human action recognition;multilayer feature representation;machine learning;hierarchical representations;video data;3D convolution;max pooling operations;Hollywood2;UCF Sports;KTH dataset","","44","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper, therefore, systematically draws attention to the importance of generation of solar electricity by using solar concentrators. Specifically, the paper links the generation of solar electricity by solar concentrators to the widespread of web-based learning in rural areas in Tanzania. The paper also examines the roles of web-based learning in stimulating interest and deep understanding of subjects for rural students in Tanzania. The paper also presents a cost breakdown of fabricating a small V-trough concentrator for rural applications. The paper concludes by suggesting how solar concentrators for solar electricity generation can be developed and implemented in Tanzania as well as discussing the practical impacts of solar electricity on various sectors in rural areas.","","","10.1109/ICL.2014.7017919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7017919","Web-based learning;solar electricity;solar concentrators;solar panel/module;rural areas","Electricity;Educational institutions;Mobile handsets;Materials;Electronic learning;Economics","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;Internet;solar cells;solar energy concentrators","secondary schools;primary schools;Tanzania;learning materials;Web-based learning;electronic media;concentrating systems;solar electricity generation;solar concentrators;rural areas;V-trough concentrator","","","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The CD states within a cluster cannot be distinguished during decoding. This problem, referred to as the clustering problem, is not explicitly addressed in the current literature. In our previous work, a regression-based CD-DNN framework was proposed to address both the data sparsity and the clustering problems. This paper investigates several refinements for the regression-based CD-DNN including two more representative state approximation schemes and the incorporation of sequential learning. The two approximations are obtained based on the statistics learned from the training data. Sequential learning is applied to both broad phone DNN detectors and the regression NN. The proposed refinements are evaluated on a broadcast news transcription task. For the cross-entropy systems, the two approximations perform consistently better than our previous work. Consistent performance gain over the corresponding cross-entropy trained systems is also observed for both the baseline CD-DNN and the regression model with sequential learning.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854155","Context Dependent Modelling;Deep Neural Network;Logistic Regression;Canonical State Modelling;Articulatory Features;Sequential Learning","Approximation methods;Training;Speech recognition;Detectors;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Neural networks","decision trees;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;speech recognition","baseline CD-DNN;cross-entropy trained systems;broadcast news transcription task;broad phone DNN detectors;sequential learning;representative state approximation schemes;regression-based CD-DNN framework;clustering problem;training targets;decision tree state clusters;speech recognition;deep neural networks;CD acoustic modelling;context-dependent acoustic modelling;data sparsity problem","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to achieve optimal efficiency in a learning process, individual learner's cognitive learning style should be taken into account. Due to different types of learners using these systems, it is necessary to provide them with an individualized learning support system.

In particular their (many) hierarchical levels of composition track the development of parallel implementation in an attempt to become accessibly fast. When it comes to performance enhancement Graphics Processing Units (GPU) have carved their own strength in machine learning. In this paper, we present an approach that relies mainly on three kernels for implementing both the Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and Deep Belief Networks (DBN) algorithms. Instead of considering the neuron as the smallest unit of computation each thread represents the connection between two (one visible and one hidden) neurons. Although conceptually it may seem weird, the rationale behind is to think of a connection as performing a simple function that multiplies the clamped input by its weight. Thus, we maximize the GPU workload avoiding idle cores. Moreover, we placed great emphasis on the kernels to avoid uncoalesced memory accesses as well as to take advantage of the shared memory to reduce global memory accesses. Additionally, our approach uses a step adaptive learning rate procedure which accelerates convergence. The approach yields very good speedups (up to 46×) as compared with a straightforward implementation when both GPU and CPU implementations are tested on the MINST database.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2012.6252431","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252431","","Kernel;Graphics processing unit;Instruction sets;Computer architecture;Training;Neurons;Vectors","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;graphics processing units;learning (artificial intelligence);multiprocessing systems","restricted Boltzmann machines;deep belief networks;multicore processors;deep learning architecture models;shallow models;biological inspiration;graphics processing units;machine learning;RBM;DBN;GPU workload maximization;step adaptive learning rate procedure;CPU implementations;MINST database","","9","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key characteristics of deep web data sources is that data can only be accessed through the limited query interface they support. This paper develops a methodology for mining the deep web. Because these data sources cannot be accessed directly, thus, data mining must be performed based on sampling of the datasets. The samples, in turn, can only be obtained by querying the deep web databases with specific inputs. Unlike existing sampling based methods, which are typically applied on relational databases or streaming data, sampling costs, and not the computation or memory costs, are the dominant consideration in designing the algorithm. In this paper, we specifically target the frequent itemset mining problem, and develop a method based on the theory of active learning. We focus on effectively obtaining a sample that can achieve a good estimation for the support values of 1-itemsets comprising an output attribute. In our method, a Bayesian network is utilized to describe the relationship between the input and the output attributes. We have evaluated our method using one synthetic and two real datasets. Our comparison shows significant gains in estimation accuracy from both the novel aspects of our work, i.e., the use of active learning and modeling a deep web source with a Bayesian network. On all three datasets, by sampling less than 10% of all data records, we could achieve more than 95% accuracy in estimating the support of frequent itemsets.","","","10.1109/ICDE.2011.5767919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5767919","","Bayesian methods;Data mining;Estimation;Itemsets;Accuracy;Sampling methods","Bayes methods;data mining;information dissemination;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing;relational databases;sampling methods","active learning;frequent itemset mining;data dissemination;data access;query interface;data mining;dataset sampling;deep web databases;relational databases;data streaming;Bayesian network;synthetic datasets","","5","37","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been a challenging task because domain-specific WDBs' forms with dynamic and heterogeneous properties are very sparsely distributed over several trillion Web pages. Although significant efforts have been made to address the problem and its special cases, more intelligent and effective solutions remain to be further explored. In this paper, a new architecture of an intelligent agent-based crawler (iCrawler) for domain-specific Deep Web databases has been proposed to address the limitations of the existing methods. The iCrawler, based on intelligent learning agents and domain ontology, and a series of novel and effective strategies, including a two-step page classifier, a link scoring strategy, etc, can improve the performance of the existing methods.

This recently proposed level-set formulation achieves reasonably accurate results in several segmentation problems, and has the advantage of eliminating periodic re-initializations during the optimization process, and as a result it avoids numerical errors. Nevertheless, when applied to challenging problems, such as the left ventricle segmentation from short axis cine magnetic ressonance (MR) images, the accuracy obtained by this distance regularized level set is lower than the state of the art. The main reasons behind this lower accuracy are the dependence on good initial guess for the level set optimization and on reliable appearance models. We address these two issues with an innovative structured inference using deep belief networks that produces reliable initial guess and appearance model. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on the MICCAI 2009 left ventricle segmentation challenge, where we show that our approach achieves one of the most competitive results (in terms of segmentation accuracy) in the field.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909795","Non-rigid segmentation;Deep learning;Deep inference;Level sets method","Image segmentation;Training;Shape;Level set;Accuracy;Active contours;Heart","belief networks;biomedical MRI;image segmentation;medical image processing;optimisation","fully automated non-rigid segmentation;distance regularized level set evolution;deep-structured inference;deep belief networks;periodic reinitialization elimination;optimization process;left ventricle segmentation;magnetic resonance images;MR images;innovative structured inference;MICCAI 2009","","10","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Original feature selection methods choose genes/miRNAs based on their individual features regardless of how they perform together. Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes. Experimental results show that the approach was able to outperform classical feature selection methods in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 9%, lung cancer by 6% and breast cancer by around 10% in F1-measure.

Under the assumption that, by construction, this dictionary of templates is composed from similar classes, and samples the orbit of variance-inducing signal transformations (such as shift and scale), the resulting signature is theoretically guaranteed to be unique, invariant to transformations and stable to deformations.

It does not even need exposure to any instances of those classes. The learning occurs while the net is being trained to discriminate among a set of related classes. This form of transfer learning is referred to as `Latent Learning' by psychologists, because until specifically elicited, the knowledge remains latent. Evidence that latent learning has occurred lies in the existence of consistent, unique responses to the unseen classes. Standard supervised learning can improve the accuracy of those responses with exceedingly small sets of labeled images. In this paper, we use a convolutional neural net (CNN) to demonstrate not only a method of determining a net's latent responses, but also simple ways to optimize latent learning. Additionally, we take advantage of the fact that CNN's are deep nets in order to show how the latently learned accuracy of the CNN may be greatly improved by allowing only its output layer to train.

In this paper we propose a shared-hidden-layer multilingual DNN (SHL-MDNN), in which the hidden layers are made common across many languages while the softmax layers are made language dependent. We demonstrate that the SHL-MDNN can reduce errors by 3-5%, relatively, for all the languages decodable with the SHL-MDNN, over the monolingual DNNs trained using only the language specific data. Further, we show that the learned hidden layers sharing across languages can be transferred to improve recognition accuracy of new languages, with relative error reductions ranging from 6% to 28% against DNNs trained without exploiting the transferred hidden layers.

On the other hand, the previously commonly used hand-crafted features also encodes the prior knowledge about the data. By realizing that the hand-crafted features and machine learnt features actually characterize the different aspects of image data, rather than only using one type of feature, we propose to jointly use the machine learnt features and hand-crafted features for RGB-D object recognition.

One-shot recognition is a visual classification task, where only one training sample is available for each object category in the target test domain, with the help of prior-knowledge data from the source domain. In this paper, we tackle this challenging one-shot recognition problem under a more exciting setting by using only unlabeled images as prior knowledge, which requires less labeling effort than previous works which adopt fully labeled data and/or a sophisticated attribute table designed by human experts. We propose a novel unsupervised hierarchical feature learning framework to learn a feature pyramid from the prior-knowledge domain. The proposed feature learning method also could be applied across multiple feature spaces. Furthermore, we propose using pyramid-matching kernels to combine multilevel features.

For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a deep sparse autoencoder on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200×200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting from these learned features, we trained our network to recognize 22,000 object categories from ImageNet and achieve a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6639343","","Face;Neurons;Detectors;Training;Accuracy;Buildings;Visualization","face recognition;image coding;object detection;unsupervised learning","unsupervised learning;high-level class-specific feature detectors;face detector;deep sparse autoencoder;model parallelism;asynchronous SGD;cat faces;human bodies;ImageNet;picture size 200 pixel","","390","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To train a deep network efficiently, greedy layer-wise pre-training and fine tuning are required. Typically, pre-training, aiming to initialize a deep network, is implemented via unsupervised feature learning, with multiple feature representations generated. However, in general only the last layer representation is to be employed because of its abstraction and compactness being the best with comparisons to the ones of lower layers. To make full use of the representations of all layers, this paper proposes a feature ensemble learning method based on sparse autoencoders for image classification. Specifically, we train three softmax classifiers by using the representations of different layers, instead of one classifier trained by applying the last layer representation. Of the three softmax classifiers, two are obtained by training stacked autoencoders with fine tuning, and the other one is obtained by directly using a concatenation of two representations. To improve accuracy and stability of a single softmax classifier, the ensemble of multiple classifiers is considered, and some Naive Bayes combination rules are introduced to integrate the three classifiers. Experimental results on the MNTST and COIL datasets are presented, with comparisons to other classification methods.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889415","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889415","deep network;feature representation;feature ensemble;autoencoder;softmax;Naive Bayes","Joints;Conferences;Neural networks","belief networks;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","feature ensemble learning;sparse autoencoders;image classification;deep networks;function approximation;greedy layer-wise pretraining;unsupervised feature learning;feature representations;softmax classifiers;last layer representation;naive Bayes combination rules;MNTST dataset;COIL dataset;classification methods","","7","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training billions of parameters in these models such as restricted boltzmann machines (RBMs) appears to be computational challenging for modern CPUs. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) has been employed in many large-scale deep learning models for performance enhancement due to its massively parallel computing capability. Unfortunately, the limited device memory of GPUs imposes a restriction on the size of the model trained on a single GPU.

In this paper, we proposed a novel memory efficient algorithm on single GPU that can train large-scale RBMs without size restriction and preserve the performance gain of GPU parallel computation.

The high computation and storage requirements of DLNs have led to the exploration of various avenues for their efficient realization. Concurrently, the ability of emerging post-CMOS devices to efficiently mimic neurons and synapses has led to great interest in their use for neuromorphic computing. We describe SPINDLE, a programmable processor for deep learning based on spintronic devices. SPINDLE exploits the unique ability of spintronic devices to realize highly dense and energy-efficient neurons and memory, which form the fundamental building blocks of DLNs. SPINDLE consists of a three-tier hierarchy of processing elements to capture the nested parallelism present in DLNs, and a two-level memory hierarchy to facilitate data reuse. It can be programmed to execute DLNs with widely varying topologies for different applications. SPINDLE employs techniques to limit the overheads of spin-to-charge conversion, and utilizes output and weight quantization to enhance the efficiency of spin-neurons. We evaluate SPINDLE using a device-to-architecture modeling framework and a set of widely used DLN applications (handwriting recognition, face detection, and object recognition). Our results indicate that SPINDLE achieves 14.4X reduction in energy consumption and 20.4X reduction in EDP over the CMOS baseline under iso-area conditions.","","","10.1145/2627369.2627625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7298216","Spintronics;Emerging Devices;Nanoelectronics;Post-CMOS;Neural Networks;Neuromorphic Computing","Neurons;Memristors;Semiconductor device modeling;CMOS integrated circuits;Magnetoelectronics;Integrated circuit modeling;Magnetic tunneling","CMOS integrated circuits;learning (artificial intelligence);magnetoelectronics;neural chips","SPINDLE;spintronic deep learning engine;large-scale neuromorphic computing;DLNs;bio-inspired large-scale neural networks;post-CMOS devices;programmable processor;spintronic devices;energy-efficient neurons;three-tier hierarchy;two-level memory hierarchy;data reuse;spin-to-charge conversion;weight quantization;spin-neurons efficiency;device-to-architecture modeling framework;14.4X reduction in energy consumption","","31","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, randomized approximate feature maps have emerged as an elegant mechanism to scale-up kernel methods. Still, in practice, a large number of random features is required to obtain acceptable accuracy in predictive tasks. In this paper, we develop two algorithmic schemes to address this computational bottleneck in the context of kernel ridge regression. The first scheme is a specialized distributed block coordinate descent procedure that avoids the explicit materialization of the feature space data matrix, while the second scheme gains efficiency by combining multiple weak random feature models in an ensemble learning framework. We demonstrate that these schemes enable kernel methods to match the performance of state of the art Deep Neural Networks on TIMIT for speech recognition and classification tasks. In particular, we obtain the best classification error rates reported on TIMIT using kernel methods.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6853587","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6853587","large-scale kernel machines;random features;distributed computing;deep learning;speech recognition","Kernel;Training;Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Training data;Speech recognition","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;regression analysis;speech recognition","kernel methods;deep neural networks;TIMIT;tractable convex optimization techniques;large-scale speech applications;randomized approximate feature maps;kernel ridge regression;specialized distributed block coordinate descent procedure;feature space data matrix;multiple weak random feature models;ensemble learning framework;speech recognition;speech classification tasks","","24","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we present a cortex-inspired learning network, Where-What Networks (WWN), for the problem of unsupervised learning of binocular local features. The results show that the learned features autonomously developed selectivity for disparity, profile and location of the input patterns. We present a novel algorithm, Dynamic Synapse Lobe Component Analysis (DSLCA), which not only resembles the pattern of neural connections in the visual cortex, but also results in the autonomous development of “domain disparity”. To our knowledge, this work is the first to introduce unsupervised learning of both domain and weight disparities between left and right local receptive fields. Moreover, given the theoretical optimality of WWNs [2] and their empirically proven strength in supervised learning, the presented work is the first step towards creating a semi-supervised learning network for simultaneous type, location (including distance) and 3D shape perception.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2013.6706848","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6706848","","Neurons;Vectors;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Encoding;Radio frequency;Visualization","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;shape recognition;stereo image processing;unsupervised learning","3D shape perception;supervised learning;neural connections;DSLCA;dynamic synapse lobe component analysis;WWN;where what networks;cortex inspired learning network;restricted Boltzman machines;deep belief networks;learning algorithms;machine learning;unsupervised binocular feature learning","","1","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous work on moving object detection mostly use point features based on 3D geometric constraints. However, point features require good features, and are hard to detect or to be matched correctly in situations where objects have smooth textures. To alleviate this problem, learning high-level spatio-temporal features unsupervisedly from raw image data based on Reconstruction Independent Component Analysis (RICA) autoencoders is proposed. Despite the power of the new spatio-temporal features, these features cannot not learn and be used to interpret 3D geometry of dynamic scenes, which is critical for moving object detection from moving cameras. As detected moving points based on 3D geometric constraints still contain valuable information of 3D scene as well as the camera egomotion, we propose a framework that incorporates both the detected moving point results and the learned spatio-temporal features as inputs to Recursive Neural Networks (RNN) that performs motion segmentation. Both features effectively complement each other. The proposed approach is demonstrated with real-world stereo video data that contains multiple moving objects, and has achieved 26% better detection rate over the existing 3D geometric-based moving points detector.","","","10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907299","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907299","","Motion segmentation;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Cameras;Computer vision;Image edge detection","feature extraction;image motion analysis;image segmentation;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;stereo image processing;traffic engineering computing;video signal processing","3D geometric-based moving point detector;real-world stereo video data;recursive neural networks;camera egomotion;3D scene;RICA autoencoders;reconstruction independent component analysis;3D geometric constraints;point feature detection;moving object detection;moving stereo camera;motion segmentation;geometric-based moving point detection;deep spatiotemporal feature learning","","11","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple signoff corners, libraries, design methodologies, and implementation flows make timing closure very complex at advanced technology nodes. Design teams often wish to ensure that one tool's timing reports are neither optimistic nor pessimistic with respect to another tool's reports. The resulting “correlation” problem is highly complex because tools contain millions of lines of black-box and legacy code, licenses prevent any reverse-engineering of algorithms, and the nature of the problem is seemingly “unbounded” across possible designs, timing paths, and electrical parameters. In this work, we apply a “big-data” approach to the timer correlation problem. We develop a machine learning-based tool, Golden Timer eXtension (GTX), to correct divergence in flip-flop setup time, cell arc delay, wire delay, stage delay, and path slack at timing endpoints between timers. We propose a methodology to apply GTX to two arbitrary timers, and we evaluate scalability of GTX across multiple designs and foundry technologies / libraries, both with and without signal integrity analysis. Our experimental results show reduction in divergence between timing tools from 139.3ps to 21.1ps (i.e., 6.6×) in endpoint slack, and from 117ps to 23.8ps (4.9× reduction) in stage delay. We further demonstrate the incremental application of our methods so that models can be adapted to any outlier discrepancies when new designs are taped out in the same technology / library. Last, we demonstrate that GTX can also correlate timing reports between signoff and design implementation tools.","","","10.7873/DATE.2014.273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6800474","","Delays;Wires;Silicon;Training;Libraries;Integrated circuit modeling","Big Data;delays;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence)","deep learning methodology;golden signoff timing analysis;advanced technology nodes;timing paths;electrical parameters;Big-Data approach;timer correlation problem;machine learning-based tool;GTX;golden timer extension;flip-flop setup time;cell arc delay;wire delay;stage delay;path slack;signal integrity analysis;foundry technology-libraries;endpoint slack;outlier discrepancies;IC design flow;time 139.3 ps to 21.1 ps","","","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current study investigates if certain types of learning styles correlate to student conceptual learning in undergraduate dynamics. Each of the students (86 last quarter) in the course took the index of learning styles (ILS) based on the Felder-Silverman model. The ILS assesses student preferences on four key dimensions: active/reflective, sensing/intuitive, visual/verbal, and sequential/global. Although some may argue on which learning styles model is the most appropriate, the ILS has been validated and reported often in the literature. Student scores on each of the four dimensions were recorded on the numerical score of 1-11.

As a result, there are many methods to solve them. Some of the most effective techniques on the benchmark data are Meta heuristic methods. Unfortunately, these methods rely upon either parameter tuning or deep understanding of domain knowledge. They are not capable of dealing with other different problems. Thus, this has led to the development of hyper heuristics system. One contribution of this paper is to attempt to use the extended great deluge (EGD) method as a move acceptance method to drive the selection of low level heuristic within hyper heuristic (HH) framework. Moreover, hyper heuristic search with memory, which is also used to store the accepted solutions at each iteration, is also applied.

However, the granularity division is itself an open and complex problem. Deep learning, at the same time, has been proposed by Geoffrey Hinton, which simulates the hierarchical structure of human brain, processes data from lower level to higher level and gradually composes more and more semantic concepts. The information similarity, proximity and functionality constitute the key points in the original insight of granular computing proposed by Zadeh. Many GrC researches are based on the equivalence relation or the more general tolerance relation, either of which can be described by some distance functions. The information similarity and proximity depended on the samples distribution can be easily described by the fuzzy logic. From this point of view, GrC can be considered as a set of fuzzy logical formulas, which is geometrically defined as a layered framework in a multi-scale granular system. The necessity of such kind multi-scale layered granular system can be supported by the columnar organization of the neocortex. So the granular system proposed in this paper can be viewed as a new explanation of deep learning that simulates the hierarchical structure of human brain. In view of this, a novel learning approach, which combines fuzzy logical designing with machine learning, is proposed in this paper to construct a GrC system to explore a novel direction for deep learning. Unlike those previous works on the theoretical framework of GrC, our granular system is abstracted from brain science and information science, so it can be used to guide the research of image processing and pattern recognition. Finally, we take the task of haze-free as an example to demonstrate that our multi-scale GrC has high ability to increase the texture information entropy and improve the effect of haze-removing.","","","10.1109/GrC.2013.6740397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740397","Granular Computing;Leveled Granular System;Fuzzy Logic;Deep Learning;Haze Free;brain-like computer","Visualization;Organizations;Fuzzy logic;Information entropy;Pattern recognition;Vectors;Entropy","brain;entropy;fuzzy logic;granular computing;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence)","visual haze-free task;granular computing;granularity division;deep learning;hierarchical human brain structure;higher-level data processing;lower-level data processing;information similarity;information proximity;information functionality;equivalence relation;general tolerance relation;distance functions;fuzzy logical formulas;geometry;layered framework;multiscale layered granular system;columnar organization;neocortex;machine learning;brain science;information science;image processing;pattern recognition;multiscale GrC system;texture information entropy improvement;haze-removing effect improvement","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accuracy, robustness, and scalability of obtained solutions have been verified through emulation experiments performed on a large data set of real data acquired by a networked swarm of robots.","","","10.1109/ICRA.2014.6907338","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6907338","","Robot sensing systems;Image segmentation;Feature extraction;Vectors;Neural networks;Robustness","feature extraction;human-robot interaction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);multi-robot systems;object recognition;recurrent neural nets;robot vision","online feature extraction;gesture incremental learning;human-swarm interaction;hand gesture online feature learning;swarm robotic system;multirobot systems;convolutional max-pooling;CMP;feed-forward two-layer network;deep hierarchical max-pooling convolutional neural network;MPCNN;2nd order online learning method;soft-confidence weighted learning scheme;SCW learning scheme;recognition task;swarm-level classification;distributed consensus;classifiers;robot networked swarm","","5","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Individuals were scanned while reading text the size of words in loud reading. Three experiments were performed corresponding to different degrees of grammatical complexity that is performed during loud reading: (1) words and pseudo-words were presented to subjects; (2) words with diacritical marking and words without diacritical markings were presented to subjects; (3) Hebrew words with Hebrew root and Hebrew words without Hebrew root were presented to subjects. The working hypothesis was that the more complex the needed grammatical processing needed, the more difficult it should be to perform the classification at the level of temporal and spatial resolution given by an fMRI signal. We were able to accomplish the first task completely. The second and third task did not succeed when all the data is used simultaneously. However, the third task was successful when training and testing was done within a continuous scanning run. (The experimental protocol did not allow this for the second task.) This does establish that complex linguistic information is decodable from fMRI scans. On the other hand, the need to restrict to the intra-run situation indicates that additional work is needed to compensate for distortions introduced between scanning runs.","","","10.1109/EEEI.2014.7005833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005833","Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI);Multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA);Machine Learning;Pattern Matching;Neural Networks;Cognitive Processing","Biological neural networks;Training;Testing;Reliability;Noise;Neurons;Standards","biomedical MRI;cognition;linguistics","deep grammatical information;event related fMRI;linguistic characteristics;read text;machine learning techniques;loud reading;grammatical complexity;pseudowords;diacritical marking;Hebrew words;Hebrew root;fMRI signal temporal resolution;fMRI signal spatial resolution","","2","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most of the existing methods focus on modeling the similarity/dissimilarity relationship among instances, such as k-means and spectral clustering, and ignore to extract more effective representation for clustering. In this paper, we propose a deep embedding network for representation learning, which is more beneficial for clustering by considering two constraints on learned representations. We first utilize a deep auto encoder to learn the reduced representations from the raw data. To make the learned representations suitable for clustering, we first impose a locality-persevering constraint on the learned representations, which aims to embed original data into its underlying manifold space. Then, different from spectral clustering which extracts representations from the block diagonal similarity matrix, we apply a group sparsity constraint for the learned representations, and aim to learn block diagonal representations in which the nonzero groups correspond to its cluster. After obtaining the learned representations, we use k-means to cluster them. To evaluate the proposed deep embedding network, we compare its performance with k-means and spectral clustering on three commonly-used datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising performance.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976982","","Neural networks;Clustering methods;Image reconstruction;Clustering algorithms;Linear programming;Manifolds","data handling;data structures;learning (artificial intelligence);matrix algebra;pattern clustering","deep embedding network;pattern clustering;data structure;pattern recognition;machine learning;spectral clustering;learning representation;locality persevering constraint;manifold space;block diagonal similarity matrix","","18","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The clinical experience are classified as the patterns of disease diagnosis and Chinese medical Zheng diagnosis, the identification of core elements of Zheng, the treatment experience and relation of herbal medicine formulae, Zheng and disease, and the common law of diagnosis and treatment in real practice. The source of the experience mainly originates from literature and manuscripts of CM masters, which are being electronically recorded during the last two decades. As a result, it makes feasible to apply data mining to the knowledge discovery through the experience of veteran CM doctors. However, the current focus on this field is limited to the published literature such as journal papers, conference proceedings and textbooks, but the paper based manuscripts personally written by the veteran doctors are usually neglected. In this paper, we established a database for Dr Situ Ling, who is a deceased famous CM acupuncture master in southern China. The study objective is to discover the acupuncture point selection patterns which require profession knowledge and experience from senior CM doctors. It is believed these patterns are deposited as underlying knowledge with various middle level concepts that can be analyzed and discover by a serial of algorithms. Thus in this work, we formularized the patterns of acupuncture point selection as a learning task with deep architecture, which attempts to capture either existent or underlying concepts so as to simulate the planning process of the combined diagnosis of western medicine and Chinese medicine. The Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) was used as the main model for deep learning to process to medical record data with international standard diagnosis (ICD-10) previously made by trained doctors. Then the ICD-10 based diagnosis dataset was introduced into our framework to enhance the concepts diversity. After applying this model, the learning accuracy based on the medical record database of Dr Situ Ling was raised up to 75%. Thus this model can serve as a solution to discover the acupuncture point selection patterns of CM acupuncture veteran doctors. Furthermore, the data mining study model linked by international diagnosis standard (i.e. ICD-10), point selection patterns, and clinical symptoms will provide useful cues to reveal the essence of Zheng diagnosis through experience of CM veteran doctors.","","","10.1109/BIBMW.2012.6470346","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470346","deep learning;veteran doctor of Chinese medicine;knowledge discover;acupuncture point patterns;ICD-10","Medical diagnostic imaging;Diseases;Standards;Pain;Training;Data models","Boltzmann machines;data mining;medical computing;medical information systems;patient diagnosis","acupuncture point selection patterns;Chinese medicine;disease diagnosis patterns;Chinese medical Zheng diagnosis;Zheng core element identification;herbal medicine formulae;CM master literature;CM master manuscripts;data mining;veteran CM doctor experience;journal papers;conference proceedings;textbooks;CM acupuncture master;southern China;serial algorithm;planning process simulation;western medicine;restricted Boltzmann machines;RBM;international standard diagnosis;ICD-10 based diagnosis dataset;medical record database;clinical symptoms","","2","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As for aerospace computer, a common challenge is the Single Event Upset (SEU) effect, which would change the state of some information bits stochastically and lead to error results. Due to the time-consuming and data-intensive computation of aerospace computer, digital signal processing (DSP) is the most suitable for aerospace computation.

"Learning feature hierarchies under reinforcement","A. Knittel","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales, Australia","2012 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","","2012","","","1","8","Learning feature hierarchies, where larger features are composed of smaller re-used features, is an important area of study in object recognition and classification, and relates to processes in the human visual system. Established techniques are able to build deep hierarchies using neural networks, such as deep learning based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines, however approaches using other machine learning techniques involving reinforcement are not well established. An approach is presented that uses a form of Learning Classifier System to build a hierarchical feature network, for classification of images using the MNIST dataset. Larger scale representations of rules are composed of re-used smaller elements, in a network of 4,000 features and 2,000 rules. The feature network is developed autonomously, according to reinforcement of rules the features participate in. An implementation is shown using the ARCS classifier system to perform classification of images, using rules based on image templates. A second implementation uses rules with image templates constructed from a hierarchical feature network. This shows effective classification performance, but not as accurate as the best neural network and kernel methods. The implementation shows the ability to construct a hierarchical feature network under reinforcement, and its application to develop a rule population used by a Learning Classifier System. An alternative method for modifying existing rules is shown to substitute for standard mutation and crossover processes, to allow exploration of the rule space more closely related to gradient descent and cognitively related processes, rather than the genetic analogy commonly used in learning classifier systems.","","","10.1109/CEC.2012.6256569","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6256569","","Buildings;Feature extraction;Accuracy;Training;Machine learning;Neural networks;Genetic algorithms","Boltzmann machines;feature extraction;gradient methods;image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition","reinforcement learning feature hierarchies;reused features;object recognition;object classification;human visual system;neural networks;restricted Boltzmann machines;machine learning techniques;learning classifier system;hierarchical feature network;image classification;MNIST dataset;large scale rule representations;ARCS classifier system;image templates;gradient descent processes;cognitively related processes;genetic analogy","","2","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) is one of the techniques to inspect and classify application traffic. There are various existing methods (port based, payload based, statistical analysis, time based behavior etc) to identify application traffic using DPI. However, each method has its own advantages and limitations. This paper suggests a composite self-learning DPI method to identify application flows using correlated flows and statistical analysis. It is observed that most application flows have some correlated flow(s) which can easily be identified by existing methods. Our approach uses this property. It keeps information about identified flows found during observed unidentified flow. Once sufficient number of records are found, it can correlate this unidentified flow with corresponding identified flows found and conclude about unidentified flow being part of one of the identified flow application. Many applications change behavior of one of its flows in newer versions. Since all other flows from that application can be detected using old signature, the newer unidentified flow can easily be correlated with them. This method can add newly identified flow vector in statistical engine in real-time, thus updating statistical data set without manual analysis and tagging. The test results indicate that this method is accurate and it identifies traffic with high degree of reliability.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268534","DPI;Deep Packet Inspection;Stateful Application identification;correlated flows;statistical analysis","Cryptography;Correlation;Training;Databases;Protocols;YouTube","data communication;inspection;Internet telephony;peer-to-peer computing;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;vectors","self-learning stateful application identification method;deep packet inspection;data communication techniques;Internet service providers;P2P traffic;VoIP traffic;correlated flows;statistical analysis;flow vector;degree of reliability","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a more advanced type of DNN, which we call the deep tensor neural network (DTNN). The DTNN extends the conventional DNN by replacing one or more of its layers with a double-projection (DP) layer, in which each input vector is projected into two nonlinear subspaces, and a tensor layer, in which two subspace projections interact with each other and jointly predict the next layer in the deep architecture. In addition, we describe an approach to map the tensor layers to the conventional sigmoid layers so that the former can be treated and trained in a similar way to the latter. With this mapping we can consider a DTNN as the DNN augmented with DP layers so that not only the BP learning algorithm of DTNNs can be cleanly derived but also new types of DTNNs can be more easily developed. Evaluation on Switchboard tasks indicates that DTNNs can outperform the already high-performing DNNs with 4-5% and 3% relative word error reduction, respectively, using 30-hr and 309-hr training sets.","","","10.1109/TASL.2012.2227738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353550","Automatic speech recognition;CD-DNN-HMM;large vocabulary;tensor deep neural networks","Tensile stress;Speech recognition;Neural networks;Vocabulary;Vectors;Speech;Speech processing","backpropagation;hidden Markov models;neural nets;speech recognition;tensors","deep tensor neural network;large vocabulary speech recognition;DTNN;context-dependent deep neural network hidden Markov models;CD-DNN-HMM;double-projection layer;DP layer;nonlinear subspaces;subspace projections;deep architecture;sigmoid layers;BP learning algorithm;switchboard tasks;relative word error reduction;time 30 hour;time 309 hr","","51","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We use grounded theory to answer the research question: How do students construct knowledge in a POGIL classroom? Constructivist grounded theory was used to code student interview data and develop a theory of how student learning occurs. The resulting theory shows that the use of POGIL results in a concept-focused class, as opposed to focusing on discrete aspects of knowledge (facts). This concept-focused class provides for both conceptual understanding and improved retention of information. The findings illustrate one way to design a class for deep conceptual understanding and suggest broader implications for curriculum design.","","","10.1109/FIE.2013.6684824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6684824","active learning;guided inquiry;grounded theory","Materials;Engineering education;Educational institutions;Interviews;Chemistry;Equations","engineering education","guided inquiry classroom;engineering education;active learning environment;student outcomes;student learning;process oriented guided inquiry learning classroom;POGIL classroom;constructivist grounded theory;student interview data;concept-focused class;discrete aspects;conceptual understanding;information retention;curriculum design","","","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, deep neural networks (DNNs) have gained more attention and successfully applied to process high-dimensional data composed not only of single modality but also of multimodal information. We introduced DNNs to construct multimodal association model which can reconstruct one modality from the other modality. Our model is composed of two DNNs: one for image compression and the other for audio-visual sequential learning. We tried to reproduce synaesthesia phenomenon by training our model with the multimodal data acquired from psychological experiment. Cross-modal association experiment showed that our model can reconstruct the same or similar images from sound as synaesthetes, those who experience synaesthesia.

The state-of-the-art and most popular such machine-learning algorithms are Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks (CNNs and DNNs), which are known to be both computationally and memory intensive. A number of neural network accelerators have been recently proposed which can offer high computational capacity/area ratio, but which remain hampered by memory accesses. However, unlike the memory wall faced by processors on general-purpose workloads, the CNNs and DNNs memory footprint, while large, is not beyond the capability of the on chip storage of a multi-chip system. This property, combined with the CNN/DNN algorithmic characteristics, can lead to high internal bandwidth and low external communications, which can in turn enable high-degree parallelism at a reasonable area cost. In this article, we introduce a custom multi-chip machine-learning architecture along those lines. We show that, on a subset of the largest known neural network layers, it is possible to achieve a speedup of 450.65x over a GPU, and reduce the energy by 150.31x on average for a 64-chip system.

This paper illustrates how each of these three aspects contributes to the DBN's good recognition performance using both phone recognition performance on the TIMIT corpus and a dimensionally reduced visualization of the relationships between the feature vectors learned by the DBNs that preserves the similarity structure of the feature vectors at multiple scales.

One key advantage of such neural networks is their ability to learn from very long observation windows going up to 400 ms. Given this very long temporal context, it is tempting to wonder whether one can run neural networks at a lower frame rate than the typical 10 ms, and whether there might be computational benefits to doing so.

Each site integrates input from a subset of synapses and is able to generate regenerative potentials. The sites exchange information in stereotyped ways: Signals from the soma are transmitted to the apical dendrite via actively back-propagating dendritic action potentials. Slow regenerative calcium spikes transmit information from the apical dendrite to the soma. These calcium spikes lead to a strong and prolonged depolarization of the cell generating a burst of action potentials. This paper analyzes how the system learns if these calcium spikes trigger hebbian learning at active synapses. A cell is now described by two main variables the mean activity and the mean potential at the apical dendrite with the first variable defining the input to cells downstream and the latter what the cell learns. A system results where neurons learn to respond to those features that are correlated with activity on the higher layer, this property is similar to maximizing the mutual information between input and higher areas.

Our results support the importance of using an effective regularization method, and indicate the adaptive, data-depended regularization mechanism of a DBN is more powerful than the simple methods of model selection / weight decay / early stopping.","","","10.1109/CIBCB.2012.6217244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6217244","machine learning;generalization;reuglarization;neural network;deep architecture;generative model;DNA barcoding","Training;DNA;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Correlation;Complexity theory;Noise","belief networks;bioinformatics;biological techniques;data handling;DNA;learning (artificial intelligence);molecular biophysics;molecular configurations;neural nets","sequence learning;sparse data analysis;high dimensional spaces;biological sequence classification;sparsely populated input space;inductive bias;regular neural networks;deep belief networks;DNA barcoding classification;adaptive data dependent regularization mechanism","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While progress in deep learning shows the importance of learning features through multiple layers, it is equally important to learn features through multiple paths. We propose Multipath Hierarchical Matching Pursuit (M-HMP), a novel feature learning architecture that combines a collection of hierarchical sparse features for image classification to capture multiple aspects of discriminative structures. Our building blocks are MI-KSVD, a codebook learning algorithm that balances the reconstruction error and the mutual incoherence of the codebook, and batch orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), we apply them recursively at varying layers and scales.

In its simplest form, a supervised learning algorithm, typically a deep neural network, is trained to learn a mapping from noisy features to a time-frequency representation of the target of interest. Traditionally, the ideal binary mask (IBM) is used as the target because of its simplicity and large speech intelligibility gains. The supervised learning framework, however, is not restricted to the use of binary targets. In this study, we evaluate and compare separation results by using different training targets, including the IBM, the target binary mask, the ideal ratio mask (IRM), the short-time Fourier transform spectral magnitude and its corresponding mask (FFT-MASK), and the Gammatone frequency power spectrum. Our results in various test conditions reveal that the two ratio mask targets, the IRM and the FFT-MASK, outperform the other targets in terms of objective intelligibility and quality metrics. In addition, we find that masking based targets, in general, are significantly better than spectral envelope based targets.

The problem is formulated as a sequential importance resampling algorithm such that the expected segmentation of the current time step is estimated based on the appearance, shape, and motion models that take into account all previous and current images and previous segmentation contours produced by the method. The new appearance and shape models decouple the affine and nonrigid segmentations of the left ventricle to reduce the running time complexity. The proposed motion model combines the systole and diastole motion patterns and an observation distribution built by a deep neural network. The functionality of our approach is evaluated using a dataset of diseased cases containing 16 sequences and another dataset of normal cases comprised of four sequences, where both sets present long axis views of the left ventricle. Using a training set comprised of diseased and healthy cases, we show that our approach produces more accurate results than current state-of-the-art endocardium tracking methods in two test sequences from healthy subjects.

DCE-MRI analysis, looking at the change of the MR contrast-agent concentration over successively acquired images, is time-series analysis. We analyse the change of brightness (which is related to the contrast-agent concentration) of the DCE-MRI images over time to classify different tissue types in the images. Therefore our system is an application of an auto encoder to time-series analysis while the demonstrated result and further possible successive application areas are in computer vision.

However, most approaches so far rely on having a single, complete training set. If the distribution of relevant features changes during subsequent training stages, the features learned in earlier stages are gradually forgotten. Often it is desirable for learning algorithms to retain what they have previously learned, even if the input distribution temporarily changes. This paper introduces the M-DBN, an unsupervised modular DBN that addresses the forgetting problem. M-DBNs are composed of a number of modules that are trained only on samples they best reconstruct. While modularization by itself does not prevent forgetting, the M-DBN additionally uses a learning method that adjusts each module's learning rate proportionally to the fraction of best reconstructed samples. On the MNIST handwritten digit dataset module specialization largely corresponds to the digits discerned by humans. Furthermore, in several learning tasks with changing MNIST digits, M-DBNs retain learned features even after those features are removed from the training data, while monolithic DBNs of comparable size forget feature mappings learned before.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2011.6033359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6033359","","Training;Training data;Support vector machines;Computer architecture;Indexes;Force;Image reconstruction","belief networks;data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence)","modular deep belief networks;learning algorithms;unsupervised modular DBN;MNIST handwritten digit dataset;high-dimensional data learning compact representations","","4","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sensitivity of the network output is derived as a function of weight perturbation in different hidden layers. For a given hidden layer l, the output sensitivity varies inversely with current activation levels of neurons of the previous layer l-1, and the magnitude of the connection weights between layers l and l-1. Learning involves modifying weights. Relatively small connection weights (usually during initial learning phase of BP algorithm), or small neuron activation levels can increase the sensitivity of the network and make learning unstable. This problem is further aggravated as the depth of the network increases. A weight initialization strategy and a modified activation (sigmoid) function are proposed to alleviate these problems. Using this scheme, deep networks trained with the error backpropagation learning rule show substantial improvement in error curve (trajectory) control and convergence speed when applied to pattern recognition problems.","","","10.1109/ICNN.1996.549108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=549108","","Pattern recognition;Neurons;Neural networks;Error correction;Multi-layer neural network;Computer networks;Feedforward neural networks;Convergence;Backpropagation algorithms;Artificial neural networks","feedforward neural nets","deep feedforward networks;pattern recognition;weight perturbation;hidden layers;output sensitivity;learning;neuron activation;sigmoid function;error backpropagation;convergence","","1","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Providing better phonetic context information in the input gives improved performance for DNN. The state projection vectors (state specific vectors) in subspace Gaussian mixture model (SGMM) captures the phonetic information in low dimensional vector space. In this paper, we propose to use state specific vectors of SGMM as features thereby providing additional phonetic information for the DNN framework. To each observation vector in the train data, the corresponding state specific vectors of SGMM are aligned to form the state specific vector feature set. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) feature set are formed by applying LDA to the training data. Since bottleneck features are efficient in extracting useful discriminative information for the phonemes, LDA feature set and state specific vector feature set are converted to bottleneck features. These bottleneck features of both feature sets act as input features to train a single DNN framework. Relative improvement of 8.8% for TIMIT database (core test set) and 9.7% for WSJ corpus is obtained by using the state specific vector bottleneck feature set when compared to the DNN trained only with LDA bottleneck feature set. Also training Deep belief network - DNN (DBN-DNN) using the proposed feature set attains a WER of 20.46% on TIMIT core test set proving the effectiveness of our method. The state specific vectors while acting as features, provide additional useful information related to phoneme variation.

The injection took place at the bottom of the 4-km-deep pilot borehole in the SE2 fault zone in crystalline rock units between the springs of 2004 and 2005. Prior to the experiment, theoretical calculations indicated a possible increase in the compressional wave reflection coefficient as a result of an injection-induced reduction of the seismic velocities within the fault zone.Despite good repeatability of the emitted source signals, the experiment suffered from missing the clear reflection signals expected from the fault zone with regard to seismic data from past experiments. Applying various data-processing steps did not enhance the signals enough to obtain clear reflections or even pressure-dependent reflection amplitude changes. The signal-to-noise ratio remains smaller than the effects under observation. Provided that reflections are present in the data, the error bar of the recorded signals is of the order of 100 per cent. Therefore, we conclude that the experiment was not successful in seismically measuring pressure variations. However, important lessons for land seismic time-lapse measurements in crystalline environments have been learned: (i) The source should be capable of emitting frequencies below 30 Hz. (ii) The detector array setup proved to be partly questionable because in a scattering environment like the crystalline rocks at the KTB site, the incidence of a plane wave precondition might be violated for high-frequency signals. (iii) Near-surface variations of elastic properties likely influence seismic monitoring. (iv) Using a step function, that is a first-order pressure discontinuity, to model the subsurface pressure build-up, is very likely too simple an approach.","","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2009.04405.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8143598","Time series analysis;Permeability and porosity;Fracture and flow;Controlled source seismology;Site effects","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Recent work has shown how to incorporate a shape prior into a CRF for improving labeling performance, but it may be difficult to model temporal dependencies present in video by using this prior. The conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) can model both shape and temporal dependencies, and has been used to learn walking styles from motion- capture data. In this work, we incorporate a CRBM prior into a CRF framework and present a new state-of-the-art model for the task of semantic labeling in videos.

These advances have been motivated by and related to the optimization issues surrounding deep learning. Although recurrent networks are extremely powerful in what they can in principle represent in terms of modeling sequences, their training is plagued by two aspects of the same issue regarding the learning of long-term dependencies. Experiments reported here evaluate the use of clipping gradients, spanning longer time ranges with leaky integration, advanced momentum techniques, using more powerful output probability models, and encouraging sparser gradients to help symmetry breaking and credit assignment. The experiments are performed on text and music data and show off the combined effects of these techniques in generally improving both training and test error.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2013.6639349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6639349","Recurrent networks;deep learning;representation learning;long-term dependencies","Training;Optimization;Recurrent neural networks;Biological neural networks;Computational modeling;Entropy","learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;recurrent neural nets","test error;music data;credit assignment;symmetry breaking;sparser gradients;output probability models;advanced momentum;clipping gradients;long term dependencies;deep learning;recurrent neural networks optimization","","115","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Direct approaches to assess reachability involve the solution to a two-point boundary value problem (2PBVP) between a pair of states. Alternative, indirect approaches involve the characterization of reachable sets as level sets of the value function of an appropriate optimal control problem. Both methods solve the problem accurately, but are computationally intensive and do no appear amenable to real-time implementation for all but the simplest cases. In this work, we leverage machine learning techniques to devise query-based algorithms for the approximate, yet real-time solution of the reachability problem. Specifically, we show that with a training set of pre-solved 2PBVP problems, one can accurately classify the cost-reachable sets of a differentially-constrained system using either (1) locally-weighted linear regression or (2) support vector machines. This novel, query-based approach is demonstrated on two systems: the Dubins car and a deep-space spacecraft. Classification errors on the order of 10% (and often significantly less) are achieved with average execution times on the order of milliseconds, representing 4 orders-of-magnitude improvement over exact methods. The proposed algorithms could find application in a variety of time-critical robotic applications, where the driving factor is computation time rather than optimality.","","","10.1109/IROS.2014.6942859","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942859","","Support vector machines;Training;Vectors;Equations;Machine learning algorithms;Chebyshev approximation","boundary-value problems;learning (artificial intelligence);mobile robots;optimal control;query processing;reachability analysis;regression analysis;set theory;support vector machines","machine learning approach;real-time reachability analysis;dynamical system;reachability assessment;two-point boundary value problem;optimal control problem;machine learning techniques;query-based algorithms;presolved 2PBVP problems;cost-reachable sets;differentially-constrained system;locally-weighted linear regression;support vector machines;query-based approach;Dubins car;deep-space spacecraft;time-critical robotic applications;computation time","","9","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Compared to a speaker-adaptive GMM system, the relative improvement is 18%, at very similar end-to-end runtime.

Almost same error rates will be achieved, if we change weights in the bottom interlayer according to transformations occurred in testing data. It implies that weights in the bottom interlayer can store the knowledge to handle transformations such as rotation, shifting, and scaling. Along with the continuous learning ability and good storage of DBN, we present our Weight-Transformed Training Algorithm (WTTA) without augmenting other layers, units or filters to original DBN. Based upon original training method, WTTA is aiming at transforming weights and is still unsupervised. For MNIST handwritten digits recognizing experiments, we adopted 784-100-100-100 DBN to compare the differences of recognizing ability in weights-transformed ranges. Most error rates generated by WTTA were below 25% while most rates generated by original training algorithm exceeded 25%. Then we also did an experiment on part of MIT-CBCL face database, with varying illumination, and the best testing accuracy can be achieved is 87.5%. Besides, similar results can be achieved by datasets covering all kinds of transformations, but WTTA only needs original training data and transform weights after each training loop.

The role of learning is undoubtedly of prime importance in autonomic network management since in principle, it allows for the introduced management and control functionality to exhibit “human”-like self-x attributes and behaviour and adapt to changing network and user conditions. This means that the human operator is offloaded from configuration and reconfiguration tasks that would otherwise require their constant attention and their very deep understanding of low-level network operations and dynamics. When so, human intervention is needed only when, despite the self-x efforts of the various management and control processes, the overall targets cannot be met. In this paper we present the approach of the ongoing UniverSelf project with respect to the role of learning. This paper presents how the learning framework fits in the overall management framework put forward by the project and what the requirements that the learning solutions must exhibit are.

The normalization problem is related to the difficulty of training probabilistic models over large spaces while keeping them properly normalized. In recent years, the ML and natural language communities have devoted considerable efforts to circumventing this problem by developing ""un-normalized"" learning models for tasks in which the output is highly structured (e.g. English sentences). This class of models was in fact originally developed during the 90's in the handwriting recognition community, and includes graph transformer networks, conditional random fields, hidden Markov SVMs, and maximum margin Markov networks. We describe these models within the unifying framework of ""energy-based models"" (EBM). The deep learning problem is related to the issue of training all the levels of a recognition system (e.g. segmentation, feature extraction, recognition, etc) in an integrated fashion. We first consider "" traditional"" methods for deep learning, such as convolutional networks and back-propagation, and show that, although they produce very low error rates for handwriting and object recognition, they require many training samples. We show that using unsupervised learning to initialize the layers of a deep network dramatically reduces the required number of training samples, particularly for such tasks as the recognition of everyday objects at the category level.","","","10.1109/ICDAR.2007.4378728","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4378728","","Computer vision;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Pattern recognition;Natural languages;Handwriting recognition;Markov random fields;Feature extraction;Error analysis;Object recognition","backpropagation;computer vision;document image processing;handwriting recognition;natural language processing;unsupervised learning","energy-based models;document recognition;computer vision;machine learning;pattern recognition;normalization problem;deep learning problem;probabilistic models;natural language;graph transformer networks;conditional random fields;hidden Markov SVM;maximum margin Markov networks;backpropagation;unsupervised learning","","13","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Alternatively, we address both challenges by modeling the physical constraints of a guitar to produce human-readable representations of music audio, i.e guitar tablature via a deep convolutional network.

For image quality assessment (IQA), psychological evidence shows that humans prefer qualitative descriptions for image quality rather than numerical ones. However, the qualitative evaluation of image quality has to be converted into numerical scores in order to train the state-of-the-art learning based methods. Why cannot IQA models learn from the qualitative description directly? To this end, a united deep framework is proposed in this paper. The model could learn the relationship between image features and qualitative labels without converting them into numerical scores. With the aid of saliency-guided features, the learned deep model classifies the images into five grades, corresponding to five explicit linguistic variables, and then a new quality pooling is designed to transform the qualitative labels to scores for comparison and general use. The framework not only reduces the randomness of numerical scores by learning qualitatively, but is also robust against noise and the small training dataset. Experiments are conducted on popular databases to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed IQA method.","","","10.1109/ICME.2014.6890168","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6890168","blind image quality assessment;visual attention;deep learning;natural scene statistics","Image quality;Databases;Visualization;Training;Measurement;Feature extraction;Robustness","image classification","saliency-guided deep framework;visual attention;human language;image quality assessment;psychological evidence;image classification;explicit linguistic variables;IQA method","","2","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In practical vehicle detection application, both speed and accuracy are required. So increasing the speeds of DNN while keeping its high accuracy has significant meaning for many recognition and detection applications. We introduce parallel branches into the DNN. The maps of the layers of DNN are divided into several parallel branches, each branch has the same number of maps. There are not direct connections between different branches. Our parallel DNN (PNN) keeps the same structure and dimensions of the DNN, reducing the total number of connections between maps. The more number of branches we divide, the more swift the speed of the PNN is, the conventional DNN becomes a special form of PNN which has only one branch. Experiments on large vehicle database showed that the detection accuracy of PNN dropped slightly with the speed increasing. Even the fastest PNN (10 times faster than DNN), whose branch has only two maps, fully outperformed the traditional methods based on features (such as HOG, LBP). In fact, PNN provides a good solution way for compromising the speed and accuracy requirements in many applications.","","","10.1109/ACPR.2013.33","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778306","Remote Sensing;Object detection;Deep convolutional Neural Networks","Vehicles;Training;Vehicle detection;Accuracy;Feature extraction;Biological neural networks","convolution;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;object detection;object recognition;road vehicles","satellite image;parallel deep convolutional neural networks;machine learning method;object recognition;vehicle detection application;parallel DNN;PNN;large vehicle database;HOG;LBP","","26","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, a background model is learned based on these images by using another auto-encoder network (called Background Network). To be more resilient, our background model can be updated on-line to absorb more training samples. Our main contributions are 1) the architecture of the couple of auto-encoder networks which can model the background very efficiently; 2) the online learning algorithm in which a method of searching the minimizing effect parameters is adopted to accelerate the training of the Reconstruction Network.

The lower layer is a neural network in which Q-learning is simulated. The inputs are the state variables, and the outputs are the Q-values for each action. It is tuned to update and store the Q-table. The upper layer watches the activity in the lower layer to identify the group of nodes that are activated when some action in the lower layer obtains a high reward from the environment. In this way, new symbols emerge that are embedded in the lower layer to speed up the learning. When an important concept is learned, the corresponding symbol is generalized and embedded in a different place at a lower level. Simulation has demonstrated that symbol emergence and the forced application of these symbols in Q-learning greatly improves the performance of players playing a simple football game.

The difficulty is added when several pedestrians overlap in images and occlude each other. We observe, however, that the occlusion/visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians provide useful mutual relationship for visibility estimation - the visibility estimation of one pedestrian facilitates the visibility estimation of another. In this paper, we propose a mutual visibility deep model that jointly estimates the visibility statuses of overlapping pedestrians. The visibility relationship among pedestrians is learned from the deep model for recognizing co-existing pedestrians. Experimental results show that the mutual visibility deep model effectively improves the pedestrian detection results. Compared with existing image-based pedestrian detection approaches, our approach has the lowest average miss rate on the Caltech-Train dataset, the Caltech-Test dataset and the ETH dataset.

As for LDA, discriminative features generated from independent Gaussian class conditionals are assumed. This modeling has the advantages that the intrinsic dimensionality of the feature space is bounded by the number of classes and that the optimal discriminant function is linear. Unfortunately, linear transformations are insufficient to extract optimal discriminative features from arbitrarily distributed raw measurements. The generalized discriminant analysis (GerDA) proposed in this paper uses nonlinear transformations that are learnt by DNNs in a semisupervised fashion. We show that the feature extraction based on our approach displays excellent performance on real-world recognition and detection tasks, such as handwritten digit recognition and face detection. In a series of experiments, we evaluate GerDA features with respect to dimensionality reduction, visualization, classification, and detection. Moreover, we show that GerDA DNNs can preprocess truly high-dimensional input data to low-dimensional representations that facilitate accurate predictions even if simple linear predictors or measures of similarity are used.","","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2183645","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6149591","Deep neural networks;dimensionality reduction;discriminant analysis;face detection;feature extraction;restricted Boltzmann machines;sensor fusion","Feature extraction;Training;Visualization;Covariance matrix;Optimization;Nickel;Neural networks","feature extraction;Gaussian distribution;neural nets","deep neural networks;generalized discriminant analysis;classical linear discriminant analysis;LDA;independent Gaussian class conditionals;feature space intrinsic dimensionality;optimal discriminant function;optimal discriminative feature extraction;nonlinear transformations;handwritten digit recognition;face detection","Algorithms;Computer Simulation;Discriminant Analysis;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Models, Statistical;Neural Networks (Computer);Nonlinear Dynamics;Pattern Recognition, Automated","61","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Initially one DNN is pre-trained as a feature extractor using several stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) blocks on the entire training data using unsupervised learning. This DNN is duplicated and each net is fine-tuned by training on the data represented in a specific mode using supervised learning. The target of each DNN is linked to the output from the other DNN thus ensuring matching features are learnt which are adjusted to take differing representation into account. These features are used with some distance metric to determine matches. The expected benefit of this approach is utilizing the capability of DNN to learn higher level features which can better capture the information contained in the input data's structure, while ensuring the differences in data representation are accounted for.

We compare this technique to the state-of-the-art, a one-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), showing that the DBN outperforms the SVM by the F1 measure for our EEG dataset. We also show how the outputs of a DBN-based detector can be used to aid visualization of anomalies in large EEG data sets and propose a method for using DBNs to gain insight into which features of signals are characteristically anomalous.

This is insured by performing data anonymization as required by legislation. In this context, many different anonymization techniques have been proposed in the literature. These methods are usually specific to a particular de-anonymization procedure-or attack-one wants to avoid, and to a particular known set of characteristics that have to be preserved after the anonymization. They are difficult to use in a general context where attacks can be of different types, and where measures are not known to the anonymizer. The paper proposes a novel approach for automatically finding an anonymization procedure given a set of possible attacks and a set of measures to preserve. The approach is generic and based on machine learning techniques. It allows us to learn directly an anonymization function from a set of training data so as to optimize a trade off between privacy risk and utility loss. The algorithm thus allows one to get a good anonymization procedure for any kind of attacks, and any characteristic in a given set. Experiments made on two datasets show the effectiveness and the genericity of the approach.","","","10.1109/AINA.2014.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6838788","Graph Anonymization;Machine Learning;Privacy","Loss measurement;Privacy;Data privacy;Context;Machine learning algorithms;Social network services;Noise","data privacy;graph theory;learning (artificial intelligence);risk management","graph anonymization;machine learning;data privacy;data anonymization;de-anonymization procedure;training data;privacy risk;utility loss","","4","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Design of an efficient placement and routing algorithm for 3D-FPGA that fully exploits the above mentioned advantage is a problem of deep research and commercial interest. In this paper, an efficient placement and routing algorithm is proposed for 3D-FPGAs which yields better results in terms of total interconnect length and channel-width. The proposed algorithm employs two important techniques, namely, reinforcement learning (RL) and support vector machines (SVMs), to perform the placement. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested on standard benchmark circuits and the results obtained are encouraging.

In particular, the Electroencephalogram (EEG), the Electrocardiogram (ECG) and the Electrooculogram (EOG) signals were gathered from a group of students during the execution of an Air Traffic Management (ATM) task, proposed at three different levels of difficulty. The neuroelectrical results were compared with the subjective perception of the task difficulty obtained by the NASA-TLX questionnaires. From these analyses, we suggest that the integration of information derived from the power spectral density (PSD) of the EEG signals, the heart rate (HR) and the eye-blink rate (EBR) return important quantitative information about the training level of the subjects. In particular, by focusing the analysis on the direct and inverse correlation of the frontal PSD theta (4-7 (Hz)) and HR, and of the parietal PSD alpha (10-12 (Hz)) and EBR, respectively, with the degree of mental and emotive engagement, it is possible to obtain useful information about the training improvement across the training sessions.","","","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944255","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944255","","Training;Electroencephalography;Heart rate;Air traffic control;Electrooculography;Complexity theory;Electrocardiography","air traffic control;biomechanics;cognition;computational complexity;computer based training;correlation methods;data acquisition;data analysis;electrocardiography;electroencephalography;electro-oculography;human resource management;medical computing;neurophysiology;psychometric testing;spectral analysis","neurophysiological training evaluation metric;air traffic management task;neuroelectrical cognitive metric application;training level evaluation;air traffic controller task learning;electroencephalogram signal acquisition;EEG signal acquisition;electrocardiogram signal acquisition;ECG signal acquisition;electrooculogram signal acquisition;EOG signal acquisition;ATM task difficulty level;neuroelectrical result comparison;subjective task difficulty perception;NASA-TLX questionnaires;data analysis;power spectral density information integration;EEG signal PSD;heart rate information integration;eye-blink rate information integration;quantitative training level information;direct correlation;inverse correlation;frontal PSD theta;HR PSD alpha;parietal PSD alpha;EBR;mental engagement;emotive engagement;training improvement information;training sessions;frequency 4 Hz to 7 Hz;frequency 10 Hz to 12 Hz","Aviation;Blinking;Electrocardiography;Electroencephalography;Electrooculography;Heart Rate;Humans;Learning;Neurophysiology;Teaching;Young Adult","9","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training DBNs is computationally intensive which naturally leads to investigate FPGA acceleration. Fixed-point arithmetic can have an important influence on the execution time and prediction accuracy of a DBN. Previous studies have focused only on customized DBN accelerators with a fixed data-width. Our results experiments demonstrate that supporting various data-widths in different DBN configurations and application environments does make sense for achieving acceptable performance. From this we conclude that a DBN accelerator should support various data-widths rather than the fixed one as done in previous work. The processing performance of DBN accelerators in FPGA is almost always constrained not by the capacity of the processing units, but by their on-chip RAM capacity and speed. We propose an efficient memory controller for DBN accelerators, which shows that supporting various data-widths is not as difficult as it may sound. The cost is only little in hardware terms and does not affect the critical path. We have designed a tool to help users reconfiguring the memory controller with arbitrary data-width flexibly.","","","10.1109/IPDPSW.2013.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6650881","Deep Belief Network;fixed-point arithmetic;memory controller","Random access memory;Field programmable gate arrays;Training;Educational institutions;Hardware;System-on-chip;Approximation methods","belief networks;field programmable gate arrays;storage management chips","flexible memory controller;deep belief networks;fixed-point arithmetic;state-of-art machine learning techniques;unsupervised learning algorithms;FPGA acceleration;fixed data-width;DBN accelerator;on-chip RAM capacity","","1","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is a particular challenge when asynchronous threaded discussion forums are used in e-learning settings. This paper examines the implementation of discussion forums in the context of WisdomTools Scenarios/spl trade/, an e-learning tool which exploits case-based narrative to provide authentic contexts for asynchronous, collaborative persistent conversations. An analysis of usage from two independent scenarios, one used in an academic context and the other in a corporate context, shows that embedding forums within narrative scenes encouraged learner involvement and focused conversation. At the same time, we identify directions for improving the interaction design of these forums, including the ability for learners to join and ""catch up"" in ongoing conversations, tools to view summarization postings and track learner participation, and the use of social proxies. Ultimately, our goal is to understand how narrative-based e-tools may lead to deeper learner insights, smarter strategies, and better judgments.","","","10.1109/HICSS.2004.1265285","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1265285","","Electronic learning;Discussion forums;Context;Collaborative tools;Layout;Art;Visualization;Vehicles;Government;Guidelines","computer aided instruction;computer communications software","scenarios-based e-learning environment;WisdomTools Scenarios;asynchronous threaded discussion forum;collaborative persistent conversation","","3","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We perform experiments on a Cantonese conversational telephone speech corpus and find that increasing the number of auto-encoders in the network produces more useful features, but requires pre-training, especially when little training data is available. Using more unlabeled data for pre-training only yields additional gains. Evaluations on larger datasets and on different system setups demonstrate the general applicability of our approach.

The majority of recent MEG studies have concentrated on the characterization of activity generated in relatively superficial fissural cortex. These brain areas are crucial for the initial processing of information from the senses and for the generation of movement. However, recent developments in MEG signal analysis now make possible the identification of responses from deep brain areas, such as hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum. Many of these structures participate in a variety of higher cognitive functions, including learning and memory.

Project-based learning approaches that require the students to handle realistic case studies are adequate to pursue these objectives. However, these pedagogical approaches tend to be rejected because they promote deep learning but focus on a restricted set of concepts, whereas many engineering curricula require a broad range of concepts to be covered in each course. The introduction of multiple case studies carried out simultaneously in the same course by different teams of students can broaden the set of concepts studied, but collaboration at different levels must be strongly enforced to achieve effective learning. This paper describes a multiple-case-study project design that has been applied to a computer architecture course for four years.

For example, students simply tend to write vocabulary word by word because they commonly view words as individual units. In order to resolve the issue, in this study, an association-based strategy has been introduced to assist learners in compiling vocabulary notebooks. This deep processing strategy was found more effective in regard to vocabulary retention than rote repetition strategies. To assess the strategy, an experiment was conducted to investigate the potential benefits and pitfalls in the act of learning vocabulary. This experiment mainly examined the effect of the association-based note-taking method. The experimental results show that the association-based method could increase the vocabulary retention.","","","10.1109/EITT.2014.27","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6982573","language learning strategies;vocabulary;computer-assisted language learning;language teaching methodology","Vocabulary;Electronic learning;Educational institutions;Graphics;Organizing;Organizations","computer aided instruction;natural language processing;vocabulary","association-based organizational formats;vocabulary notebooks;language learner;diverse vocabulary;communicative competence;vocabulary learning;learning vocabulary;association-based strategy;deep processing strategy;vocabulary retention;rote repetition strategy;association-based note-taking method;association-based method","","","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To investigate their effectiveness on sales, this study hypothesizes two different mechanisms, i.e., observational learning and Word-of-Mouth (WOM) via online social networks, affect shopping behaviors and sales of daily-deal vouchers. Using a unique panel data set consisting of accurate sales data of more than 500 deals from Groupon.com, this study empirically tests saliency of the two mechanisms. The findings indicate that while both mechanisms have a significantly positive association with voucher sales, the effect is stronger for Facebook-mediated WOM than for observational learning. We find that one Facebook Like on a deal, on average, is associated with two additional voucher sales and thus an increase of $215 in revenue. However, we do not find consistent evidence that Twitter-mediated WOM has any impact on the voucher sales.","","","10.1109/HICSS.2013.397","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6480195","Observational learning;word of mouth;social media;daily-deal voucher","Marketing and sales;Facebook;Twitter;Vehicles;Context;Estimation","learning (artificial intelligence);sales management;social networking (online)","effect measurement;observational learning;social-network word-of-mouth;WOM;daily-deal voucher sale;daily-deal sites;deep-discounted vouchers;marketing vehicle;shopping behaviors;Groupon.com;Facebook-mediated WOM;Twitter-mediated WOM","","15","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN) have been shown to perform very well on large scale object recognition problems. In the context of attribute classification, however, the signal is often subtle and it may cover only a small part of the image, while the image is dominated by the effects of pose and viewpoint. Discounting for pose variation would require training on very large labeled datasets which are not presently available. Part-based models, such as poselets [4] and DPM [12] have been shown to perform well for this problem but they are limited by shallow low-level features. We propose a new method which combines part-based models and deep learning by training pose-normalized CNNs. We show substantial improvement vs. state-of-the-art methods on challenging attribute classification tasks in unconstrained settings. Experiments confirm that our method outperforms both the best part-based methods on this problem and conventional CNNs trained on the full bounding box of the person.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909608","","Training;Convolution;Hair;Feature extraction;Object recognition;Glass;Neural networks","image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pose estimation","PANDA;pose aligned networks for deep attribute modeling;inferring human attributes;people images;view-point variation;pose variation;appearance variation;articulation variation;occlusion variation;convolutional neural nets;object recognition problems;attribute classification;labeled datasets;part-based models;poselets;DPM;shallow low-level features;deep learning;training pose-normalized CNN;unconstrained settings;full bounding box;pose estimation","","200","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The term mitral valve prolapse (PMV), therefore, implies that the mitral leaflets are displaced relative to some structure, generally taken to be the mitral annulus. The implications of the PMV are following: disturbed normal laminar blood flow, turbulence of the blood flow, injury of the chordae tendinae, the possibility of thrombus's composition, bacterial endocarditis and finally hemodynamic changes defined as mitral insufficiency and mitral regurgitation. Uncertainty persists about how it should be diagnosed and about its clinical importance. It is our deep belief that the echocardiography enables proper trained experts armed with proper criteria to evaluate PMV almost 100%. Unfortunately there are some problems concerned with the use of echocardiography. We have decided to start a research project aimed to find new criteria and enable general practitioners to evaluate the PMV using conventional methods and to select potential patients from the general population. To empower one to perform needed activities we developed a computer tool called ROSE (Computerised Prolaps Syndrome Determination) based on algorithms of automatic learning. This tool supports the definition of new criteria and the selection of potential PMV-patients.<>","","","10.1109/CBMS.1994.316006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=316006","","Valves;Echocardiography;Blood flow;Microorganisms;Injuries;Hemodynamics;Uncertainty;Medical diagnostic imaging;Connective tissue;Lesions","biomedical ultrasonics;cardiology;haemodynamics;medical expert systems;medical diagnostic computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","mitral valve prolapse;mitral annulus;disturbed normal laminar blood flow;blood flow turbulence;chordae tendinae;thrombus composition;bacterial endocarditis;hemodynamic change;mitral insufficiency;mitral regurgitation;echocardiography;ROSE;Computerised Prolaps Syndrome Determination;automatic learning;patient selection","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We demonstrate that our inference procedure for S3C enables scaling the model to unprecedented large problem sizes, and demonstrate that using S3C as a feature extractor results in very good object recognition performance, particularly when the number of labeled examples is low.

Several documents report the dominance of facilitator on development of those skill and performance. This paper presents a survey of perceptions of involved participants and their supervisors towards the quality of the constructionism-based employee developmental program so called the C-Paper program. The study focused on facilitator's necessary roles and competencies needed for the successful and effective program. Immersed observations and informal interviews with 4 facilitators and 22 participants in various activities during the program were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with descriptive statistics. Perception profiles of participants towards the quality of the program were recorded timely through questionnaires. Perceived satisfaction of 36 supervisors on their employees' performances was also sought for the usefulness of the program. All these results reflected the works of facilitators. This study addressed several issues. Perception profiles of participants showed great improvement, especially, between the first time of participation and a month later. Supervisors also satisfied the performances expressed by their employees in the workplace. Eight must-have competencies of facilitators were needed to be concerned, particularly, 1) an ability to develop or lead the learning process and 2) an ability to facilitate people. The program brought changes in many involved employees in the sense of their competencies. The program, by facilitators' roles and competencies, also developed productive habits of mind and self-directed learning skill to employees through various activities, especially, the contemplative education such as deep listening to other and view and accept others' values and being. Facilitators' roles and competencies appear to have strong dominance on development of employees' self-directed learning skill and productive habits of mind.

Based on findings describing the communicative functions served by these nonverbal behaviors, many virtual agent systems have modeled them to make the virtual agent look more effective and believable. One channel of nonverbal behaviors that has received less attention is head movements, despite the important functions served by them. The goal for this work is to build a domain-independent model of speaker's head movements that could be used to generate head movements for virtual agents. In this paper, we present a machine learning approach for learning models of head movements by focusing on when speaker head nods should occur, and conduct evaluation studies that compare the nods generated by this work to our previous approach of using handcrafted rules . To learn patterns of speaker head nods, we use a gesture corpus and rely on the linguistic and affective features of the utterance. We describe the feature selection process and training process for learning hidden Markov models and compare the results of the learned models under varying conditions. The results show that we can predict speaker head nods with high precision (.84) and recall (.89) rates, even without a deep representation of the surface text and that using affective information can help improve the prediction of the head nods (precision: .89, recall: .90). The evaluation study shows that the nods generated by the machine learning approach are perceived to be more natural in terms of nod timing than the nods generated by the rule-based approach.","","","10.1109/TMM.2010.2051874","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5571818","Embodied conversational agents;emotion;head nods;machine learning;nonverbal behaviors;virtual agents","Magnetic heads;Hidden Markov models;Machine learning;Speech;Predictive models;Natural languages;Data models","gesture recognition;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);motion compensation;multi-agent systems;pose estimation;prediction theory","speaker head nods prediction;affective information;face-to-face conversation;virtual agent systems;speakers head movements;domain independent model;machine learning;gesture corpus;feature selection process;learning hidden Markov models;machine learning approach;rule based approach","","16","40","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We will argue that human beings are just about to move one step forward due to continued progress in information and communication technology (ICT). Current and upcoming developments are producing a huge amount of information and knowledge that should be ubiquitously available to everyone for various scenarios and arrangements. This fact has deep implications for all individuals themselves, but particularly also for design and implementation of technological models for virtual learning that should satisfy individual user differences by respecting user strategies, self-regulation and learning management. The consideration of the conceptual background involves new advanced aspects of presentation and interaction with information as well as their implementation for enhancing the Web-based learning performance. It reflects individualization facilities and points out the significance of complex interactivity, demonstrating how the concept can be used to improve learning design efforts in education. Dealing with this matter, this paper focuses on the bridging between a Web-enabled strategy for learning reflecting individualization aspects, and the related interface design along with the required level of security, safety and privacy. Good and reliable interface design allows the user to accomplish a variety of tasks, and to operate intuitively and individually. At the same time, it can gain the attention, and help to select and access the desired adequate information. By making use of it, this strategy helps increasing the users' awareness, confidence, and acceptance towards system and educational application - a prerequisite for nowadays e-learning success stories. This paper also describes the key concept, the recent implementation and the evaluation of the virtual learning environment in progress called ""Educational Media"" (EDMedia) and includes brief conclusions as well as directions for future work according to up-coming trends in educational and knowledge technology.

The experimental results showed that the critical thinking ability of the students in the experimental group was significantly better than those in the control group, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.80","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913324","peer assessment;mobile learning;critical thinking","Mobile communication;Educational institutions;Educational technology;Learning systems;Computers;Art","computer aided instruction;educational institutions;mobile computing;mobile handsets","peer-assessment criteria development approach;student critical thinking;peer assessment strategy;effectiveness learning strategy;peer work evaluation process;school teaching;in-deep thinking;peer assessment activity;mobile device;art course;elementary school;northern Taiwan;experimental group;control group","","2","58","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many advantages to this type of Spectroscopy: it is rapid, non-destructive, and can be used to analyze solids, liquids, and gases. Unfortunately, one of the disadvantages of using Raman Spectroscopy is that the return signal measured is very weak. Thus, it is difficult to detect dilute chemical compounds in solution, such as bicarbonate and carbonate ions at natural concentrations. This paper discusses the efforts we have made to increase the sensitivity of our second generation Deep Ocean Raman In Situ Spectrometer (DORISS2). In developing this second generation instrument, we incorporated new components which improved system performance. These components include a new ruggedized U-shaped spectrometer and a back-illuminated CCD camera which is much more sensitive than our original front-illuminated CCD camera. The element which has had the most impact on system sensitivity is a set of new custom-made fiber optic cables. We had built several sets of custom fiber optic cables, but despite our efforts, their performance degraded substantially over time. Recently, we developed a new oil-filled pressure-compensated fiber optic cable which performs far better in pressure testing and is much more robust. At 6000 psig, this cable shows losses of only 2-3 dB versus our previous cables where losses of 25-30 dB were common. This new fiber optic cable was field tested in May and showed markedly improved performance","","","10.1109/OCEANS.2006.306938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4099093","","Instruments;Oceans;Raman scattering;Spectroscopy;Optical fiber cables;Optical fibers;Charge coupled devices;Charge-coupled image sensors;Optical fiber testing;Optical losses","CCD image sensors;oceanography;optical cables;Raman spectroscopy","optimizing instrument sensitivity;deep ocean Raman spectroscopy;Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute;MBARI;dilute chemical compounds;bicarbonate ions;carbonate ions;natural concentrations;second generation Deep Ocean Raman In Situ Spectrometer;DORISS2;ruggedized U-shaped spectrometer;back-illuminated CCD camera;front-illuminated CCD camera;custom-made fiber optic cables;oil-filled pressure-compensated fiber optic cable","","1","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider functions with countably infinite domains, that is functions which are mappings from the set of natural numbers to the set of natural numbers. A search algorithm samples points of a given function, producing a sequence of output values. The main result of this paper is that, given two search algorithms, and a function (computable or incomputable), then we can construct a function on which the pair of search algorithms perform identically. What is more, the Kolmogorov complexity of the functions and algorithms is related. We also show that search and bias have a deep connection. With regards to search, the ease with which we find a function in a search space consisting of programs, is the same as bias, (i.e. the preference of the search space towards one function over another). We show this for finite and countable infinite sized search spaces. The law of conservation of generalization states that for every function a learning algorithm does well on, there exists a function on which it does badly. This has previously been proved for functions over finite sized domains. Here we show how this result can be extended to functions over countably infinite sized domains.","","","10.1109/ICICISYS.2009.5358045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5358045","search;no free lunch theorem (NFL);bias;induction;machine learning;optimization","Machine learning algorithms;Machine learning;Probability distribution;Computer science;Learning systems;Algorithm design and analysis;Sampling methods","learning (artificial intelligence);search problems","incomputable functions;universal search algorithm;natural numbers;search algorithm samples;search space;learning algorithm;finite sized domains;Kolmogorov complexity","","3","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, AUVs have various problems which should be solved. In this paper, the self-organizing map (SOM) is applied as the clustering method for the navigation system. The SOM is known as one of the effective methods to extract the principle feature from many parameters and decrease the dimension of parameters. Through the competitive learning algorithms, the obtained map is tuned to express specific features of the input signals. We have been investigating the possibility of a navigation system based on SOM through simulations and experiments with an AUV called ""twin-burger"". The learning algorithm of usual SOM is unsupervised learning. However, supervised learning algorithms should be introduced because the relationship between distances information and desirable behavior of the robot, that is, the relationship from inputs to outputs should be acquired and learned. In this paper, a supervised learning algorithm is introduced into SOM and a method to adapt the local map to its environment by learning and evaluating the trajectory of robot is proposed. In the proposed method, the ""initial map"" is made static and digital vale as teaching data. In order to include more information of environment in the initial map, the trajectories of robot are evaluated, and the evaluation is utilized in the learning process. This method enables the map to have both the effect of dynamics of robot and environmental information. The efficiency of the method is investigated through the simulations and experiments.","","","10.1109/ROBOT.2004.1302421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1302421","","Navigation;Robots;Supervised learning;Trajectory;Underwater vehicles;Clustering methods;Feature extraction;Clustering algorithms;Unsupervised learning;Education","underwater vehicles;remotely operated vehicles;self-organising feature maps;path planning;mobile robots;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);computerised navigation;neurocontrollers","self-organizing map based navigation system;underwater robot;autonomous underwater vehicles;clustering method;principle feature extraction;competitive learning algorithms;twin-burger AUV;supervised learning algorithms","","9","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since dropout helps avoid over-fitting, it has also been successful on a small-scale phone recognition task using larger neural nets. However, training deep neural net acoustic models for large vocabulary speech recognition takes a very long time and dropout is likely to only increase training time.

To achieve good classification document similarity estimation is one of key techniques since classification is executed based on the document similarity. In natural language processing bag-of-words model is used to extract features from documents and term occurrence frequency based value is used as a weight of each features. However, the term weight methodologies usually use predefined models and include some limitations. New approaches to construct feature vectors based on data distribution are desired to achieve high performance of natural language processing. These days many researchers pay attention to deep learning. Deep learning is a new approach to transform raw data to feature vectors using many unlabeled data. This characteristics is desirable to satisfy a previous need. In natural language processing a main aim is to construct a language model on a deep architecture neural network. In this paper we use a deep architecture neural network to estimate document similarity. To obtain good article similarity estimation we have to generate good article vectors that can represent all article characteristics. Hence, we use many stock market news to train the deep architecture neural network and generate article vectors with the trained neural network. And we calculate cosine similarity between labeled articles and discuss performance of the deep architecture neural network. In evaluation we do not focus on articles' contents but on their sentiment polarity. Hence, we discuss whether the proposed method classifies articles according to their sentiment polarity or not. We confirmed though the proposed method is an unsupervised learning approach, it achieves good performance in stock market news similarity estimation. The results show a deep architecture neural network can be applied to more natural language processing tasks.","","","10.1109/ICIS.2013.6607825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6607825","","Vectors;Biological neural networks;Neurons;Natural language processing;Feature extraction;Estimation","document handling;feature extraction;natural language processing;neural nets;pattern classification;unsupervised learning","document similarity estimation;sentiment analysis;deep architecture neural network;document classification;natural language processing;bag-of-words model;feature extraction;term occurrence frequency based value;term weight methodologies;feature vectors;data distribution;deep learning;language model;stock market news similarity estimation;sentiment polarity;unsupervised learning approach","","5","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main vulnerability of these models resides in the need of large manually annotated training sets for the parameter estimation procedure. The issue is that these training sets need to be annotated by clinicians, which makes this training set acquisition process quite expensive. Therefore, reducing the dependence on large training sets is important for a more extensive exploration of statistical models in the LV segmentation problem. In this paper, we present a novel incremental on-line semi-supervised learning model that reduces the need of large training sets for estimating the parameters of statistical models. Compared to other semi-supervised techniques, our method yields an on-line incremental re-training and segmentation instead of the off-line incremental re-training and segmentation more commonly found in the literature. Another innovation of our approach is that we use a statistical model based on deep learning architectures, which are easily adapted to this on-line incremental learning framework. We show that our fully automatic LV segmentation method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with training sets containing less than twenty annotated images.","","","10.1109/ICCV.2011.6126433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6126433","","Image segmentation","biomedical ultrasonics;cardiology;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;parameter estimation;statistical analysis","incremental online semisupervised learning model;heart left ventricle segmentation;ultrasound data;statistical pattern recognition models;parameter estimation procedure;large training sets;online incremental retraining;deep learning architectures","","5","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they just use each instance to reconstruct itself and ignore to explicitly model the data relation so as to discover the underlying effective manifold structure. In this paper, we propose a dimensionality reduction method by manifold learning, which iteratively explores data relation and use the relation to pursue the manifold structure. The method is realized by a so called ""generalized autoencoder"" (GAE), which extends the traditional autoencoder in two aspects: (1) each instance xi is used to reconstruct a set of instances {xj} rather than itself. (2) The reconstruction error of each instance (||xj -- x'i||2) is weighted by a relational function of xi and xj defined on the learned manifold. Hence, the GAE captures the structure of the data space through minimizing the weighted distances between reconstructed instances and the original ones. The generalized autoencoder provides a general neural network framework for dimensionality reduction. In addition, we propose a multilayer architecture of the generalized autoencoder called deep generalized autoencoder to handle highly complex datasets. Finally, to evaluate the proposed methods, we perform extensive experiments on three datasets. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve promising performance.","","","10.1109/CVPRW.2014.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6910027","Autoencoder;Deep learning;Dimensionality reduction","Manifolds;Image reconstruction;Decoding;Neural networks;Principal component analysis;Data models;Linear programming","data analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","generalized autoencoder algorithm;neural network framework;dimensionality reduction methods;manifold learning;data relation exploration;reconstruction error;relational function;GAE;multilayer architecture;deep generalized autoencoder","","50","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The most popular current solutions - Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) and statistical classification, deeply rely on the availability of a training set. Besides the cumbersome need to regularly update the signatures, their visibility is limited to classes the classifier has been trained for. Unsupervised algorithms have been envisioned as a viable alternative to automatically identify classes of traffic. However, the accuracy achieved so far does not allow to use them for traffic classification in practical scenario. To address the above issues, we propose SeLeCT, a Self-Learning Classifier for Internet Traffic. It uses unsupervised algorithms along with an adaptive seeding approach to automatically let classes of traffic emerge, being identified and labeled. Unlike traditional classifiers, it requires neither a-priori knowledge of signatures nor a training set to extract the signatures. Instead, SeLeCT automatically groups flows into pure (or homogeneous) clusters using simple statistical features. SeLeCT simplifies label assignment (which is still based on some manual intervention) so that proper class labels can be easily discovered. Furthermore, SeLeCT uses an iterative seeding approach to boost its ability to cope with new protocols and applications. We evaluate the performance of SeLeCT using traffic traces collected in different years from various ISPs located in 3 different continents. Our experiments show that SeLeCT achieves excellent precision and recall, with overall accuracy close to 98%. Unlike state-of-art classifiers, the biggest advantage of SeLeCT is its ability to discover new protocols and applications in an almost automated fashion.","","","10.1109/TNSM.2014.011714.130505","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6725830","Traffic classification;clustering;self-seeding;unsupervised machine learning","Clustering algorithms;Protocols;Ports (Computers);Accuracy;Servers;Algorithm design and analysis;Training","computer network management;feature extraction;Internet;iterative methods;pattern classification;pattern clustering;protocols;statistical analysis;telecommunication traffic;unsupervised learning","label assignment;class labels;iterative seeding approach;protocols;traffic traces;ISP;precision and recall;statistical features;homogeneous clusters;signature extraction;a-priori knowledge;adaptive seeding approach;traffic classification;unsupervised algorithms;training set;statistical classification;DPI;deep packet inspection;security;network management;traffic engineering;network visibility;Internet traffic;self-learning classifier;SeLeCT","","23","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Finally, it conducts an empirical research by applying this method into a marketing team, in which it has conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the team capacity with three parameters, which are overall team capability, the contribution rate of the team capability and team performance, and provided scientific references for human resources strategies of the company.","","","10.1109/ICMLC.2010.5580514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580514","Team capability;Performance;DEA;Comprehensive evaluation","Companies;Lead;Marketing and sales;Machine learning;Cybernetics","data envelopment analysis;fuzzy set theory;matrix algebra;team working","comprehensive evaluation method;team capability;team management study;DEA method;capability business matrix;business performance matrix;DEA evaluation method;fuzzy mathematics;index system;deep layer problems;marketing team;team capacity","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These classifiers are trained sequentially without joint optimization. In this paper, we propose a new deep model that can jointly train multi-stage classifiers through several stages of back propagation. It keeps the score map output by a classifier within a local region and uses it as contextual information to support the decision at the next stage. Through a specific design of the training strategy, this deep architecture is able to simulate the cascaded classifiers by mining hard samples to train the network stage-by-stage. Each classifier handles samples at a different difficulty level. Unsupervised pre-training and specifically designed stage-wise supervised training are used to regularize the optimization problem. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the training strategy helps to avoid over fitting. Experimental results on three datasets (Caltech, ETH and TUD-Brussels) show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.","","","10.1109/ICCV.2013.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751124","","Training;Cascading style sheets;Support vector machines;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Optimization;Context modeling","backpropagation;optimisation;pattern classification;pedestrians","multistage contextual deep learning;pedestrian detection;cascaded classifiers;multistage classifiers;backpropagation;unsupervised pretraining;stage-wise supervised training;optimization","","69","57","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many features (such as histogram of oriented gradient, local binary pattern, scale-invariant feature transform, etc.) have been used to improve the performance of object detection, but mostly in simple environments such as those on roads. Kembhavi et al. proposed that no satisfactory accuracy has been achieved in complex environments such as the City of San Francisco. Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs) can learn rich features from the training data automatically and has achieved state-of-the-art performance in many image classification databases. Though the DNN has shown robustness to distortion, it only extracts features of the same scale, and hence is insufficient to tolerate large-scale variance of object. In this letter, we present a hybrid DNN (HDNN), by dividing the maps of the last convolutional layer and the max-pooling layer of DNN into multiple blocks of variable receptive field sizes or max-pooling field sizes, to enable the HDNN to extract variable-scale features. Comparative experimental results indicate that our proposed HDNN significantly outperforms the traditional DNN on vehicle detection.","","","10.1109/LGRS.2014.2309695","National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778050","Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs);hybrid DNNs (HDNNs);remote sensing;vehicle detection;Deep convolutional neural networks (DNNs);hybrid DNNs (HDNNs);remote sensing;vehicle detection","Feature extraction;Vehicles;Vehicle detection;Training;Satellites;Object detection;Remote sensing","feature extraction;neural nets;vehicles","vehicle detection;satellite images;hybrid Deep convolutional neural networks;max-pooling layer;variable receptive field sizes;max-pooling field sizes;variable-scale feature extraction","","256","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending ""giftwrapping"" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century.

Although humans can perform this job at a rate higher than chance, it is not clear how they do it [2]. However, recent studies in anthropology [24] have determined which features tend to be the most discriminative. In this study, we aim to not only create an accurate system for resemblance detection, but bridge the gap between studies in anthropology with computer vision techniques. Further, we aim to answer two key questions: 1) Do offspring resemble their parents? and 2) Do offspring resemble one parent more than the other? We propose an algorithm that fuses the features and metrics discovered via gated autoencoders with a discriminative neural network layer that learns the optimal, or what we call genetic, features to delineate parent-offspring relationships. We further analyze the correlation between our automatically detected features and those found in anthropological studies.

By combining the advantages of general low-level generative models and powerful layer-based and hierarchical models, this work aims at being a first step toward richer, more flexible models of images. After comparing various types of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) able to model continuous-valued data, we introduce our basic model, the masked RBM, which explicitly models occlusion boundaries in image patches by factoring the appearance of any patch region from its shape. We then propose a generative model of larger images using a field of such RBMs. Finally, we discuss how masked RBMs could be stacked to form a deep model able to generate more complicated structures and suitable for various tasks such as segmentation or object recognition.","","","10.1162/NECO_a_00086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6796800","","","","","","11","","","","","","MITP",""

But it was questionable whether the computers could support the acquisition of deep understanding which underlies innovative and problem solving activity. The majority of natural phenomena whose conceptual comprehension was sought was recognized to originate in collective behaviour of a multitude of participants such as molecules and atoms and their constituents. Furthermore it became clear that the fundamental principles which govern the mutual interaction of such particles could be directly imposed on them by the use of computers.

Traditional psychological stress detection usually relies on the active individual participation, which makes the detection labor-consuming, time-costing and hysteretic. With the rapid development of social networks, people become more and more willing to share moods via microblog platforms. In this paper, we propose an automatic stress detection method from cross-media microblog data. We construct a three-level framework to formulate the problem. We first obtain a set of low-level features from the tweets. Then we define and extract middle-level representations based on psychological and art theories: linguistic attributes from tweets' texts, visual attributes from tweets' images, and social attributes from tweets' comments, retweets and favorites. Finally, a Deep Sparse Neural Network is designed to learn the stress categories incorporating the cross-media attributes.

Along these two lines, it is natural to conceive of further improvement to a preset DNN-HMM recognizer by employing SAT. In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme that applies SAT to a SI DNN-HMM recognizer. We then implement the SAT scheme by allocating a Speaker-Dependent (SD) module to one of the intermediate layers of a seven-layer DNN, and elaborate its utility over TED Talks corpus data. Experiment results show that our speaker-adapted SAT-based DNN-HMM recognizer reduces the word error rate by 8.4% more than that of a baseline SI DNN-HMM recognizer, and (regardless of the SD module allocation) outperforms the conventional speaker adaptation scheme. The results also show that the inner layers of DNN are more suitable for the SD module than the outer layers.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854826","Speaker Adaptative Training;Deep Neural Network","Training;Speech recognition;Speech;Silicon;Hidden Markov models;Vectors;Acoustics","Gaussian processes;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;speaker recognition","speaker adaptive training;deep neural networks;SAT;hidden-Markov-model;HMM speech recognizer;Gaussian mixture models;speaker-independent recognizer development;training scheme;speaker-dependent module;SD module;seven-layer DNN;baseline SI DNN-HMM recognizer;speaker adaptation scheme","","30","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Next, we have conducted a series of experiments to study where the unprecedented gain of DNN comes from. Our experiments show the gain of DNN is almost entirely attributed to DNN's feature vectors that are concatenated from several consecutive speech frames within a relatively long context window. At last, we have proposed a few ideas to reconfigure the DNN input features, such as using logarithm spectrum features or VTLN normalized features in DNN.

In the training stage, the training data for the source signals are used to train a DNN. In the separation stage, the trained DNN is utilized to aid in estimation of each source in the mixed signal. Single channel source separation problem is formulated as an energy minimization problem where each source spectra estimate is encouraged to fit the trained DNN model and the mixed signal spectrum is encouraged to be written as a weighted sum of the estimated source spectra. The proposed approach works regardless of the energy scale differences between the source signals in the training and separation stages.

Instead, the non-rigid segmentation is performed directly, where points in the sparse low-dimensional can be mapped to an explicit contour representation in image space. Our proposal shows significantly smaller search and training complexities given that the dimensionality of the manifold is much smaller than the dimensionality of the search spaces for rigid detection and non-rigid delineation aforementioned, and that we no longer require a two-stage segmentation process. We focus on the problem of left ventricle endocardial segmentation from ultrasound images, and lip segmentation from frontal facial images using the extended Cohn-Kanade (CK+) database.

DNNs are the state-of-the-art models used in image recognition, object detection, classification and tracking, and speech and language processing applications. The biggest drawback to DNNs has been the enormous cost in computation and time taken to train the parameters of the networks - often a tenfold increase relative to conventional technologies. Such training time costs can be mitigated by the application of parallel computing algorithms and architectures. However, these algorithms often run into difficulties because of the cost of inter-processor communication bottlenecks. In this paper, we describe how to enable Parallel Deep Neural Network Training on the IBM Blue Gene/Q (BG/Q) computer system. Specifically, we explore DNN training using the data parallel Hessian-free 2nd order optimization algorithm. Such an algorithm is particularly well-suited to parallelization across a large set of loosely coupled processors. BG/Q, with its excellent inter-processor communication characteristics, is an ideal match for this type of algorithm. The paper discusses how issues regarding programming model and data-dependent imbalances are addressed. Results on large-scale speech tasks show that the performance on BG/Q scales linearly up to 4096 processes with no loss in accuracy. This allows us to train neural networks using billions of training examples in a few hours.","","","10.1109/SC.2014.66","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013048","Big Data;Speech Recognition;High Performance Computing","Training;Prefetching;Optimization;Synchronization;Neural networks;Speech recognition","Big Data;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;parallel architectures;pattern recognition","parallel deep neural network training;big data;DNN;machine learning techniques;pattern recognition tasks;training time costs;parallel computing algorithms;parallel architectures;IBM Blue Gene/Q computer system;IBM BG/Q computer system;data-parallel Hessian-free 2nd order optimization algorithm;interprocessor communication characteristics;programming model","","9","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In domains such as natural images, the data comes from very complex distributions which are hard to capture. Feature learning intends to discover or best approximate these underlying distributions and use their knowledge to weed out irrelevant information, preserving most of the relevant information. Feature learning can thus be seen as a form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we describe a feature learning scheme for natural images. We hypothesize that image patches do not all come from the same distribution, they lie in multiple non-linear subspaces. We propose a framework that uses K Restricted Boltzmann Machines (K-RBMs) to learn multiple non-linear subspaces in the raw image space. Projections of the image patches into these subspaces gives us features, which we use to build image representations. Our algorithm solves the coupled problem of finding the right non-linear subspaces in the input space and associating image patches with those subspaces in an iterative EM like algorithm to minimize the overall reconstruction error. Extensive empirical results over several popular image classification datasets show that representations based on our framework outperform the traditional feature representations such as the SIFT based Bag-of-Words (BoW) and convolutional deep belief networks.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2013.358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6619202","Feature Learning;Clustering;Non-Linear Subspace","Image reconstruction;Computational modeling;Training;Data models;Complexity theory;Feature extraction;Convergence","Boltzmann machines;expectation-maximisation algorithm;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural scenes","image classification;iterative EM like algorithm;image representation;K-restricted Boltzmann machines;image patches;natural images;dimensionality reduction;feature learning;K-RBM;multiple nonlinear subspaces","","5","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective function of our framework consists of two terms: 1) an embedding term which transforms the input to a low-dimensional representation with a multilayer network, and 2) a regularization term which computes the reconstruction error of the original input by unrolling the multilayer network to a deep auto encoder. We adopt a layer-by-layer pretraining procedure to obtain good initial weights for the network, and then minimize the objective function by back propagating derivatives of the two terms. To evaluate the proposed framework, we perform face recognition and digit classification experiments. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves better results than the state-of-the-art algorithms. The success of our framework further verifies deep neural network's advantages in representation learning.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6976846","","Neural networks;Face;Linear programming;Principal component analysis;Nonhomogeneous media;Manifolds;Image reconstruction","face recognition;image classification;image representation;neural nets","general nonlinear embedding framework;deep neural network;dimensionality reduction algorithms;multilayer network;low-dimensional representation;regularization term;deep auto encoder;layer-by-layer pretraining procedure;face recognition;digit classification;representation learning","","3","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The use of modality in the design of verbal aids in computer-based learning environments","E. Sanchez; H. Garcia-Rodicio","NA; NA","Interacting with Computers","","2008","20","6","545","561","Computer-based learning environments include verbal aids helping learners to gain a deep understanding. These aids can be presented in either the visual or the auditory modality. The problem is that it is not clear-cut how to present them for two reasons: the modality principle [Mayer, R.E., 2001. Multimedia Learning. Cambridge University Press, New York] is not applicable because verbal aids do not usually come with related pictures and the little empirical research on the question provides diverging results. Our aim was twofold: to present a research framework, which makes it possible to reinterpret prior findings, and to test it empirically as it provides guidelines about how to present verbal aids. It distinguishes between two types of verbal aids: regulatory, which guide the learners’ decision making process during learning, and explanatory, which help learners to revise their understanding of the to-be-learned contents. The framework suggests that explanatory aids should be presented visually and regulatory aids should be presented auditorily. In two experiments participants learned from a computer-based learning environment on plate tectonics and solved retention and inference questions afterwards. They received verbal aids presented in different modalities depending on the condition. Participants receiving visual explanatory aids outperformed those receiving auditory explanatory aids both in retention and inference questions. Participants receiving auditory regulatory aids showed no advantage; the same pattern was obtained in the second experiment, in which the auditory aids were given by a pedagogical agent. Results have practical implications for the design of computer-based materials.","","","10.1016/j.intcom.2008.08.001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147244","Computer-based learning environments;Verbal aids;Visual modality;Auditory modality","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In the approach, DBM is employed to model data distribution and the hidden information inferred by DBM together with other informative variables are then exploited by SS to form the middle level features. The features, learnt from data, can be fed to standard classifiers for classification. In order to evaluate the performance of our method, we apply our feature mapping method to two challenging tasks: (1) contour detection through distinguishing border and non-border pixels, (2) sales pipeline prediction, which predicts the winning propensity of the ongoing sales opportunity in the pipeline.

However, precise assessments must take into account the fact that the requirements for the given quality level are service-dependent. Backbone QoS monitoring and analysis requires processing of large amount of the data and knowledge of which kind of application the traffic belongs to. To overcome the drawbacks of existing methods for traffic classification we proposed and evaluated a centralized solution based on C5.0 Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) and decision rules. The first task was to collect and provide C5.0 high-quality training data, divided into groups corresponding to different types of applications. It was found that currently existing means of collecting data (classification by ports, Deep Packet Inspection, statistical classification, public data sources) are not sufficient and they do not comply with the required standards. To collect training data a new system was developed, in which the major role is performed by volunteers. Client applications installed on their computers collect the detailed data about each flow passing through the network interface, together with the application name taken from the description of system sockets. This paper proposes a new method for measuring the Quality of Service (QoS) level in broadband networks, based on our Volunteer-Based System for collecting the training data, Machine Learning Algorithms for generating the classification rules and application-specific rules for assessing the QoS level. We combine both passive and active monitoring technologies. The paper evaluates different implementation possibilities, presents the current implementation of particular parts of the system, their initial runs and obtained results, highlighting parts relevant from the QoS point of view.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6174795","broadband networks;data collecting;Machine Learning Algorithms;performance monitoring;Quality of Service;traffic classification;volunteer-based system","Quality of service;Monitoring;Delay;Training;Machine learning algorithms;Decision trees;Jitter","broadband networks;inspection;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);monitoring;pattern classification;quality of service;statistical analysis;telecommunication computing;telecommunication traffic","quality of service assessment;broadband networks;quality of service monitoring;high-speed Internet infrastructure;precise assessments;quality level;service-dependent;backbone QoS monitoring;backbone QoS analysis;traffic classification;centralized solution;C5.0 machine learning algorithm;MLA;decision rules;C5.0 high-quality training data;data collection;ports classification;deep packet inspection;statistical classification;public data sources;training data colleciton;flow passing;network interface","","5","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) is an effective tool in modeling human cognition. This paper proposes an FCM based argumentation model. Based on this model we design an argumentative software agent to facilitate argumentative learning.

The CD states within a cluster cannot be distinguished at the frame level. We surmise that the state clustering may cause an issue for the standard CD-DNNs, which has so far not been addressed in the literature. In this paper, a logistic regression framework is proposed for the CD-DNNs based on a set of broad phone classes to address both the data sparsity and the clustering problems. To address the data sparsity issue, the triphones are clustered into shorter biphones with broad phone contexts under multiple articulatory categories. A DNN is trained to discriminate the disjoint biphone clusters within each articulatory category. The regression bases are formed by the concatenated log posterior probabilities of all the broad phone DNNs. Logistic regression is used to transform the regression bases into the triphone state posteriors. Clustering of the regression parameters is used to reduce the regression model complexity while still achieving unique acoustic scores for all possible triphones. Based on some approximations, the regression model can be trained as a sparse softmax layer and its parameters can be learned by optimizing the cross-entropy criterion. The experimental results on a broadcast news transcription task reveal that the proposed regression-based CD-DNN significantly outperforms the standard CD-DNN. The best system provides a 1.3% absolute word error rate reduction compared to the best standard CD-DNN system.","","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2344855","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6872780","Articulatory features;context dependent modeling;deep neural network;logistic regression","Mathematical model;Context modeling;Context;Detectors;Approximation methods;Training;Equations","approximation theory;decision trees;neural nets;regression analysis;speech recognition","regression-based context-dependent modeling;deep neural networks;speech recognition;decision tree state clusters;context-dependent deep neural network systems;CD-DNN;data sparsity;clustering problems;multiple articulatory categories;concatenated log posterior probabilities;Logistic regression;approximations;sparse softmax layer;cross-entropy criterion","","4","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This framework learns a set of features that can generate the images of a specific object class. Our feature extraction model is a four layer hierarchy of alternating filtering and maximum subsampling. We learn feature parameters of the first and third layers viewing them as separate C-RBMs. The outputs of our feature extraction hierarchy are then fed as input to a discriminative classifier.

They are particularly well-suited to modeling local interactions among adjacent regions (e.g., super pixels). However, CRFs are limited in dealing with complex, global (long-range) interactions between regions. Complementary to this, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) can be used to model global shapes produced by segmentation models. In this work, we present a new model that uses the combined power of these two network types to build a state-of-the-art labeler. Although the CRF is a good baseline labeler, we show how an RBM can be added to the architecture to provide a global shape bias that complements the local modeling provided by the CRF. We demonstrate its labeling performance for the parts of complex face images from the Labeled Faces in the Wild data set. This hybrid model produces results that are both quantitatively and qualitatively better than the CRF alone.

To achieve this, researchers have suggested many detection systems that rely on host-monitoring techniques and require deep packet inspection or which are trained by malware samples by applying machine learning and clustering techniques. To our knowledge, most approaches are either lack of being deployed easily to real enterprise networks, because of practicability of their training system which is supposed to be trained by malware samples or dependent to host-based or deep packet inspection analysis which requires a big amount of storage capacity for an enterprise. Beside this, honeypot systems are mostly used to collect malware samples for analysis purposes and identify coming attacks. Rather than keeping experimental results of bot detection techniques as theory and using honeypots for only analysis purposes, in this paper, we present a novel automated bot-infected machine detection system BFH (BotFinder through Honeypots), based on BotFinder, that identifies infected hosts in a real enterprise network by learning approach. Our solution, relies on NetFlow data, is capable of detecting bots which are infected by most-recent malwares whose samples are caught via 97 different honeypot systems. We train BFH by created models, according to malware samples, provided and updated by 97 honeypot systems. BFH system automatically sends caught malwares to classification unit to construct family groups.

Unlike existing methods based on template matching or Bayesian inference, our approach directly maps low-level visual features to the label maps of body parts with DDN, which is able to accurately estimate complex pose variations with good robustness to occlusions and background clutters. DDN jointly estimates occluded regions and segments body parts by stacking three types of hidden layers: occlusion estimation layers, completion layers, and decomposition layers. The occlusion estimation layers estimate a binary mask, indicating which part of a pedestrian is invisible. The completion layers synthesize low-level features of the invisible part from the original features and the occlusion mask. The decomposition layers directly transform the synthesized visual features to label maps. We devise a new strategy to pre-train these hidden layers, and then fine-tune the entire network using the stochastic gradient descent. Experimental results show that our approach achieves better segmentation accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian images with or without occlusions. Another important contribution of this paper is that it provides a large scale benchmark human parsing dataset that includes 3,673 annotated samples collected from 171 surveillance videos.

Firstly, a framework of contend-based 3D model retrieval system integrated with high-level semantics is presented. Secondly, this paper concludes existing researches and divides the way of high-level semantic processing into three main categories: (1) using relevance feedback based on-line learning to integrate effectively users' high level semantic knowledge; (2) using off-line machine learning methods to narrow the gap between high-level semantic knowledge and low-level object representation; (3) using object ontology to define high-level concepts.

Unlike existing methods that assume the independence of attributes during their estimation, our approach captures the interdependencies of local regions for each attribute, as well as the high-order correlations between different attributes, which makes it more robust to occlusions and misdetection of face regions. First, we have modeled region interdependencies with a discriminative decision tree, where each node consists of a detector and a classifier trained on a local region. The detector allows us to locate the region, while the classifier determines the presence or absence of an attribute. Second, correlations of attributes and attribute predictors are modeled by organizing all of the decision trees into a large sum-product network (SPN), which is learned by the EM algorithm and yields the most probable explanation (MPE) of the facial attributes in terms of the region's localization and classification. Experimental results on a large data set with 22,400 images show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.","","","10.1109/ICCV.2013.356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6751467","face recognition;attributes;deep learning","Correlation;Face;Training;Decision trees;Robustness;Detectors;Joints","decision trees;face recognition;image classification;object detection","deep sum-product architecture;robust facial attribute analysis;image attribute estimation;local region interdependencies;high-order correlations;face region misdetection robustness;occlusion robustness;discriminative decision tree;classifier;detector;attribute correlations;attribute predictors;sum-product network;SPN;EM algorithm;most probable explanation;MPE;region localization;region classification","","51","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Human beings cannot be defined by their physical body or brain alone - just as electricity cannot be defined by the nerves through which it travels. The human brain is in fact, a system in constant flux. This distinction between the brain and the mind - that man is not a machine but has and uses a machine - the brain - is critical in understanding how we as humans learn and evolve. Recent research shows that different circuits are called upon in the brain for different activities such as math, music and reading. In addition, learning and practicing particular skills can cause corresponding areas in the brain to grow or change by adding a tiny fraction of the brain's neural circuitry and eliminating old ones. This finding is of particular interest to cybernetics which questions as to how psychological/cognitive functions are produced by brain circuits. This paper contributes to this dialogue by summarizing what we already know about the learning process in the brain and suggests how systems of communication and control operate in the brain during deep learning as for example during problem based learning.","","","10.1109/CIS.2013.6782157","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6782157","Neuron;neural network;plasticity;memory;problem based learning;mirror neuron;shared attention","Neurons;Cybernetics;Neuroscience;Hippocampus;Educational institutions","brain;cybernetics;neurophysiology","brain science;cybernetics;brain learning;perception;memory;recall;mechanistic models;brain function;human brain;neural circuitry;problem based learning","","1","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This filtering distribution depends on the observation and transition models, and since it is hard to compute the expected value using the whole parameter space of segmentations, one has to resort to Monte Carlo sampling techniques to compute the expected segmentation parameters. Generally, it is straightforward to compute probability values using the filtering distribution, but it is hard to sample from it, which indicates the need to use a proposal distribution to provide an easier sampling method. In order to be useful, this proposal distribution must be carefully designed to represent a reasonable approximation for the filtering distribution. In this paper, we introduce a new LV tracking and segmentation algorithm based on the method described above, where our contributions are focused on a new transition and observation models, and a new proposal distribution.

In Trellis, the data are broken up into subsets, a visualization method is applied to each subset, and the display result is an array of panels, one per subset. This is a powerful framework for visualization of data, both small and large. In D&R, the data are broken up into subsets, and any analytic method from statistics and machine learning is applied to each subset independently. Then the outputs are recombined. This provides not only a powerful framework for analysis, but also feasible and practical computations using distributed computational facilities. It enables deep analysis of the data: study of both data summaries as well as the detailed data at their finest granularity. This is critical to full understanding of the data. It also enables the analyst to program using an interactive high-level language for data analysis such as R, which allows the analyst to focus more on the data and less on code. In this paper we introduce Trelliscope, a system that scales Trellis to large complex data. It provides a way to create displays with a very large number of panels and an interactive viewer that allows the analyst to sort, filter, and sample the panels in a meaningful way. We discuss the underlying principles, design, and scalable architecture of Trelliscope, and illustrate its use on three analysis projects in proteomics, high intensity physics, and power systems engineering.","","","10.1109/LDAV.2013.6675164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6675164","","Data visualization;Measurement;Visualization;Data analysis;Distributed databases;Workstations;Rendering (computer graphics)","bioinformatics;data analysis;data visualisation;learning (artificial intelligence);physics computing;power engineering computing;proteomics;sorting;statistical analysis","Trelliscope;detailed visualization;large complex data deep analysis;Trellis Display framework;Divide and Recombine approach;visualization method;data visualization;statistics;machine learning;data summaries;interactive high-level language;data analysis;interactive viewer;panel sorting;panel filtering;panel sampling;proteomics;high intensity physics;power systems engineering","","6","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

VLT members are separated by spatial distance and do not have the same opportunities to communicate as do traditional learning teams. Compounding the operational challenge of establishing and maintaining VLT member relationships is the fact that their members are often non-traditional students who tend to be diverse in terms of demographics, work experience, and beliefs compared to traditional teams. Naturally, this creates challenges in facilitating social integration.

To solve this problem and to speed up the process of the convergence, we propose an improved learning method by adding a term in error function which relates to the neuron saturation of the hidden layer for the Eleman Neural Network. The activation functions are adapted to prevent neurons in the hidden layer from getting into deep saturation area. We apply this method to the Boolean Series Prediction Questions to demonstrate its validity. The simulation result shows that the proposed algorithm can avoid the local minima problem, largely accelerate the speed of the convergence and get good results for the simulation tasks.","","","10.1109/ICNC.2007.203","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4344159","","Neural networks;Neurons;Neurofeedback;Convergence;Predictive models;Recurrent neural networks;Computer networks;Data engineering;Natural languages;Learning systems","Boolean functions;learning (artificial intelligence);transfer functions","Eleman neural network;local minima problem;learning method;activation functions;Boolean series prediction questions","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There has been considerable interest in this problem in recent years due to the potential for developing objective assessments from real-world behaviors, which may provide valuable supplementary clinical information or may be useful in screening. The cues for depression may be present in “what is said” (content) and “how it is said” (prosody). Given the limited amounts of text data, even in this relatively large study, it is difficult to employ standard method of learning models from n-gram features. Instead, we learn models using word representations in an alternative feature space of valence and arousal. This is akin to embedding words into a real vector space albeit with manual ratings instead of those learned with deep neural networks [1]. For extracting prosody, we employ standard feature extractors such as those implemented in openSMILE and compare them with features extracted from harmonic models that we have been developing in recent years. Our experiments show that our features from harmonic model improve the performance of detecting depression from spoken utterances than other alternatives. The context features provide additional improvements to achieve an accuracy of about 74%, sufficient to be useful in screening applications.","","","10.1109/MLSP.2014.6958856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6958856","Depression;Speech analysis;Telemedicine","Abstracts;Speech","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;psychology;speech processing","clinical depression inferrence;speech utterances;spoken utterances;speech processing;machine learning;learning models;word representations;neural networks;openSMILE;feature extraction;harmonic models","","3","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system utilizes multiple advanced computational approaches including the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) hydrologic model for watershed simulations, interactive genetic algorithms and reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms for search and optimization, and deep learning artificial neural networks for user modeling, within an encompassing human-computer interaction framework. A substantial user study of the WRESTORE system was conducted recently involving multiple real stakeholders varying from consultants, government officials, watershed alliance members, etc., with the objective of gaining insight about WRESTORE'S usability and utility. In particular focus was the user modeling component that develops a computational model of a user's preferences and criteria, based on real-time user-provided ratings for a subset of possible designs (similar to the idea of user profiling commonly done for human-computer interaction systems).

The incremental learning method combines optimal Hebbian learning for stable feature extraction, competitive lateral inhibition for sparse coding, and neighborhood-based self-organization for topographic map generation. The computational studies reported indicate top-down connections encourage features that reduce uncertainty at the lower layer with respect to the features in the higher layer, enable relevant information to be uncovered at the lower layer so that irrelevant information can preferentially be discarded [a necessary property for autonomous mental development (AMD)], and cause topographic class grouping. Class groups have been observed in cortex, e.g., in the fusiform face area and parahippocampal place area. This paper presents the first computational account, as far as we know, explaining these three phenomena by a single biologically inspired network. Visual recognition experiments show that top-down-enabled networks reduce error rates for limited network sizes, show class grouping, and can refine lower layer representation after new conceptual information is learned. These findings may shed light on how the brain self-organizes cortical areas, and may contribute to computational understanding of how autonomous agents might build and maintain an organized internal representation over its lifetime of experiences.","","","10.1109/TAMD.2010.2072150","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5559340","Autonomous feature extraction;deep networks;Hebbian learning;self-organization;top–down connections","Neurons;Encoding;Kernel;Training;Hebbian theory;Visualization","biology computing;Hebbian learning;learning (artificial intelligence)","top down connections;self organizing Hebbian networks;topographic class grouping;feature extraction;topographic map generation;parahippocampal place area","","12","43","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper we describe a novel method for fully automatic extraction of tongue contours based on a hierarchy of restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), i.e. deep belief networks (DBNs). Usually, DBNs are first trained generatively on sensor data, then discriminatively to predict human-provided labels of the data. In this paper we introduce the translational RBM (tRBM), which allows the DBN to make use of both human labels and raw sensor data at all stages of learning. This method yields performance in contour extraction comparable to human labelers, without any temporal smoothing or human intervention, and runs in real-time.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2010.369","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5597284","Computer aided detection and diagnosis;Pattern recognition systems and applications;Signal/image representation","Ultrasonic imaging;Training;Tongue;Image reconstruction;Decoding;Humans;Speech","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;feature extraction;linguistics;ultrasonic imaging","deep belief networks;real time extraction;tongue contours;speech scientists;language sound production;ultrasound images;restricted Boltzmann machines;translational RBM;contour extraction","","19","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the ability of ML to find transportable signatures depends mainly on the training data sets. In this paper, we explore the importance of sampling training data sets for the ML algorithms, specifically Genetic Programming, C5.0, Naive Bayesian and AdaBoost, to find transportable signatures. To this end, we employed two techniques for sampling network training data sets, namely random sampling and consecutive sampling. Results show that random sampling and 90-minute consecutive sampling have the best performance in terms of accuracy using C5.0 and SBB, respectively.

Machine learning is a powerful tool for modeling correlations in physiological signals, but model complexity in typical biomedical applications makes detection too computationally intensive. We analyze the computational energy trade-offs and propose a method of restructuring the computations to yield more favorable trade-offs, especially for typical biomedical applications. We thus develop a methodology for implementing low-energy classification kernels and demonstrate energy reduction in practical biomedical systems.

Open domain question answering holds tremendous promise for facilitating informed decision making over vast volumes of natural language content. Applications in business intelligence, healthcare, customer support, enterprise knowledge management, social computing, science and government would all benefit from deep language processing. The DeepQA project (www.ibm.com/deepqa) is aimed at illustrating how the advancement and integration of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), massively parallel computation and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KR&R) can greatly advance open-domain automatic Question Answering. An exciting proof-point in this challenge is to develop a computer system that can successfully compete against top human players at the Jeopardy! quiz show (www.jeopardy.com). Attaining champion-level performance Jeopardy! requires a computer to rapidly answer rich open-domain questions, and to predict its own performance on any given category/question. The system must deliver high degrees of precision and confidence over a very broad range of knowledge and natural language content and with a 3-second response time. To do this DeepQA generates, evidences and evaluates many competing hypotheses. A key to success is automatically learning and combining accurate confidences across an array of complex algorithms and over different dimensions of evidence. Accurate confidences are needed to know when to “buzz in” against your competitors and how much to bet. Critical for winning at Jeopardy!, High precision and accurate confidence computations are just as critical for providing real value in business settings where helping users focus on the right content sooner and with greater confidence can make all the difference. The need for speed and high precision demands a massively parallel compute platform capable of generating, evaluating and combing 1000's of hypotheses and their associated evidence. In this talk I will introduce the audience to the Jeopardy! Challenge and describe our technical approach and our progress on this grand-challenge problem.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7851501","Algorithms;Performance;Design;Experimentation;Human Factors","Computers;Natural language processing;Knowledge discovery;Knowledge representation;Cognition;Decision making","information retrieval;knowledge management;knowledge representation;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing","DeepQA;human knowledge;decision making;business intelligence;enterprise knowledge management;social computing;deep language processing;natural language processing;Information Retrieval;machine learning;knowledge representation-and-reasoning;KR&R;NLP;IR;ML;open-domain automatic question answering;Jeopardy;business settings","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thereby the identification and classification of traffic play an important role for increasing the performance in network management. Primitive applications were using well-known ports in transport layer, so their traffic classification can be performed based on the port number. However, the recent applications progressively use unpredictable port numbers. Consequently the later methods are based on “deep packet inspection”. Notwithstanding proper accuracy, these methods impose heavy operational load and are vulnerable to encrypted flows. The recent methods classify the traffic based on statistical packet characteristics. However, having access to a little part of statistical flow information in real-time traffic may jeopardize the performance of these methods. Regarding the advantages and disadvantages of the two later methods, in this paper we propose an approach based on payload content and statistical traffic characteristics with Naive Bayes algorithm for real-time network traffic classification. The performance and low complexity of the propose approach confirm its competency for real-time traffic classification.","","","10.1109/IWISA.2010.5473467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5473467","","Payloads;Telecommunication traffic;Inspection;Communication system traffic control;Delay;Machine learning;Quality of service;Application software;Cryptography;Intrusion detection","Bayes methods;learning (artificial intelligence);telecommunication network management;telecommunication traffic","service requirements;network management;transport layer;port number;deep packet inspection;operational load;encrypted flows;statistical packet characteristics;statistical flow information;payload content features;statistical traffic characteristics;Naive Bayes algorithm;real-time network traffic classification","","14","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the MNIST and NORB data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and 3D objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.","","","10.1162/NECO_a_00311","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797213","","","","","","80","","","","","","MITP",""

Manipulating the direction of light illumination during the PEC process produced an undercut angle and rough surface on the sidewall of GaN LED, which enhanced light extraction by about 14% compared to a sample prepared using the conventional PEC process. A simulation based on a two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method was established to investigate the light output intensity for LED samples by manipulating different illumination directions in the PEC processes. Simulation results indicated that photons have a higher probability of being emitted from the undercut sidewall and cone-like surface of the LED structure formed by the PEC process; this improved the light extraction efficiency of GaN LED.","","","10.1109/LPT.2010.2077625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5580009","Finite-difference time-domain (FDTD);gallium nitride (GaN);light-emitting diode (LED);photoenhanced electrochemical (PEC)","Light emitting diodes;Lighting;Gallium nitride;Surface treatment;Finite difference methods;Surface roughness;Surface morphology","brightness;finite difference time-domain analysis;gallium compounds;III-V semiconductors;light emitting diodes;photoelectrochemistry;rough surfaces;wide band gap semiconductors","light-emitting diodes;photoelectrochemical process;brightness;illumination direction;rough surface;light extraction efficiency;LED;two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain method;GaN","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The teacher often faces challenges to design adequate physics problems because it demands a high effort to have enough variety of exercises for several students' levels. In addition, it is important to display exercises in an attractive visual and interactive environment, but this requires deep computer knowledge. Most common simulators in the literature are visually attractive, but are often designed to solve a particular or limited problem. Authoring tools have the advantage to allow building several learning environments, involving professors without computer expertise. Therefore, teachers require less effort and time to develop simulation problems. In this work we present an on line authoring simulation tool, called AuthorPhysics, aimed to facilitate the design of physics active learning problems, reducing instructors' time and effort. An initial evaluation of the usability and benefits of the system for the instructors was carried on.

The autoencoder is used to extract sparse features, which are expected to be noise invariant in the observations. The stacked RBMs then observe the sparse features as inputs to learn the top hierarchical features. The use of RBMs is motivated by the fact that the stacked RBMs typically provide good performance when dealing with in-sample observations, as proven in the previous works. To improve the robustness against local noise, we propose a variant of our hybrid network by the usage of a mixture of sparse features and sparse connections in the auto-encoder layer.

It rendezvoused with the asteroid Itokawa after a two-year deep space flight using the ion engines. Though it succeeded in landing on the asteroid on November 2005, the spacecraft was seriously damaged. This delayed Earth return in 2010 from the original plan in 2007. Reconstruction on the operational scheme using thrust vector control of ion engines, Xe cold gas jets and solar pressure torque made Hayabusa leave for Earth in April 2007. Although most of the neutralizers were degraded and unable to be used in fall of 2009, a combination of an ion source and its neighboring neutralizer has kept the orbit maneuver to Earth including a series of final trajectory correction maneuvers. Finally, the spacecraft decayed in atmosphere and only the reentry capsule was retrieved from the Australian outback on June 14th, 2010. For the round trip space odyssey between Earth and the asteroid, the ion engines served the total accumulated operational time 39,637 hour·unit, the powered spaceflight in 25,590 hours, delta-V of 2.2 km/s, total impulse of 1 MN·s and 47 kg Xenon propellant consumption.","","","10.1109/AERO.2011.5747599","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5747599","","Space vehicles;Propulsion;Earth;Sun;Torque;Engines;Orbits","aerospace instrumentation;asteroids;astronomical instruments;celestial mechanics;space vehicles","cathode-less electron cyclotron resonance ion engines;Hayabusa asteroid explorer;electric propulsion;optical navigation;material sampling;zero gravity field;heliocentric orbit;Itokawa asteroid;deep space flight;thrust vector control;solar pressure torque;Xe cold gas jets;round trip space odyssey;spaceflight;Xenon propellant consumption","","16","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Product-like and specially designed on chip diagnostic structures are inspected as soon as active layer patterning and isolation is complete.

The second kernel matrix is computed from active appearance model coefficients and a radial basis function kernel. During the training step, we combine these two types of features using the recently proposed SimpleMKL algorithm. SVM outputs are then averaged to exploit temporal information in the sequence. To evaluate our system, we perform deep experimentation on several key issues: influence of features and kernel function in histogram-based SVM approaches, influence of spatially independent information versus geometric local appearance information and benefits of combining both, sensitivity to training data, and interest of temporal context adaptation.

Its goal is to decide, if two texts are written by the same author or not. We present an efficient Authorship Verification scheme based on an ensemble of K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers, where each classifier generates a decision regarding a feature category. Our scheme provides many benefits such as, for instance, the independence of linguistic resources like thesauruses or language models. Furthermore, it can handle different Indo-European languages as for instance English, German, Spanish, Greek, Dutch, Swedish or French. Another benefit is the low runtime, due to the fact that deep linguistic processing (tagging, chunking, parsing, etc.) is not taken into account. Moreover, our scheme can easily be modified for example by replacing the involved distance function, the acceptance criterion or the used features including their parameters. The proposed scheme is evaluated against the publicly available PAN-2013 Author Identification (AI) test corpus, where it was ranked as the second-best in the top ten list, as well as against five other test corpora, compiled by our own.

We report results using multiple postprocessing methods to produce the final labeling. Among those, we propose a technique to automatically retrieve, from a pool of segmentation components, an optimal set of components that best explain the scene; these components are arbitrary, for example, they can be taken from a segmentation tree or from any family of oversegmentations.

This paper presents an approach toward automated signature generation, mitigating classification problems experienced with existing systems. A hierarchical system is proposed, where signatures are developed and deployed in real-time. The ideas set forth in this research are evaluated by experimentation in a live network environment.

Second, the manifold topology comprises multiple charts, which contrasts to the most current methods that assume one single chart, being overly restrictive. The proposed algorithm, Gaussian process multiple local models (GP-MLM), can deal with arbitrary manifold topology by decomposing the manifold into multiple local models that are probabilistic combined using Gaussian process regression. In addition, the paper presents a multiple filter architecture where standard filtering techniques are integrated within the GP-MLM. The proposed approach exhibits comparable performance of state-of-the-art trackers, namely multiple model data association and deep belief networks, and compares favorably with Gaussian process latent variable models.

In this paper, we tackle this problem by using the Multi-integrated Sensor Technology, which comes at a low price. At the same time, we are aiming to address the lightweight learning requirements by investigating Factored Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines (FCRBMs), a form of Deep Learning, that has proven to be an efficient and effective machine learning framework. However, due to their construction properties, the conventional FCRBMs are only capable of performing predictions but are not capable of making classification. Herein, we are proposing extended FCRBMs (eFCRBMs), which incorporate a novel classification scheme, to solve this problem. Experiments performed on both artificially generated as well as real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed technique.

Dropout training discourages the detectors in the network from co-adapting, which limits the capacity of the network and prevents overfitting. In this paper we show that annealing the dropout rate from a high initial value to zero over the course of training can substantially improve the quality of the resulting model. As dropout (approximately) implements model aggregation over an exponential number of networks, this procedure effectively initializes the ensemble of models that will be learned during a given iteration of training with an enemble of models that has a lower average number of neurons per network, and higher variance in the number of neurons per network-which regularizes the structure of the final model toward models that avoid unnecessary co-adaptation between neurons. Importantly, this regularization procedure is stochastic, and so promotes the learning of “balanced” networks with neurons that have high average entropy, and low variance in their entropy, by smoothly transitioning from “exploration” with high learning rates to “fine tuning” with full support for co-adaptation between neurons where necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that annealed dropout leads to significant reductions in word error rate over standard dropout training.","","","10.1109/SLT.2014.7078567","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078567","Maxout Networks;Deep Neural Networks;Deterministic Annealing;Dropout Training;Model aggregation;Annealed Dropout","Annealing;Training;Hidden Markov models;Data models;Neurons;Schedules;Error analysis","neural nets","annealed dropout training;regularization procedure;deep neural networks","","18","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We address this issue by introducing interactive training (IT), a logical extension to backpropagation training that employs interaction among multiple networks. This method is based on the theory that centralized control is more effective for learning in deep problem spaces in a multi-agent paradigm. IT methods allow networks to work together to form more complex systems while not restraining their individual ability to specialize. Lazy training, an implementation of IT that minimizes misclassification error, is presented. Lazy training discourages overfitting and is conducive to higher accuracy in multiclass problems than standard backpropagation. Experiments on a large, real world OCR data set have shown interactive training to significantly increase generalization accuracy, from 97.86% to 99.11%.

The system is supported by use of a simple interpolation mechanism, which allows the improvement of the original low-dimensionality of feature sets to a significantly higher dimensionality with minimal computation. This in turn, improves the performance of SVM classifiers while reducing the computation otherwise required to generate directly measured features.

Here we present a 3-stage pipeline to construct a representative protein sequence dataset, generate training data and pre-train deep network models for 1-D and 2-D protein structure prediction tasks. To handle the complexities of managing the large dataset, we implemented our pipeline using the MapReduce framework. This allowed us to leverage existing tools such as Hadoop.

Our existing approach uses extended recognition networks (ERNs) to constrain the recognition paths to the canonical pronunciation of the target words and the likely phonetic mispronunciations. Although this approach is viable, it has some problems: (1) deriving appropriate phonological rules to generate the ERNs remains a challenging task; (2) the acoustic model (AM) and the phonological rules are trained independently and hence contextual information is lost; and (3) phones missing from the ERNs cannot be recognized even if we have a well-trained AM. Hence we propose an Acoustic Phonological Model (APM) using a multi-distribution DNN, whose input features include acoustic features and corresponding canonical pronunciations. The APM can implicitly learn the phonological rules from the canonical productions and annotated mispronunciations in the training data. Furthermore, the APM can also capture the relationships between the phonological rules and related acoustic features. As we do not restrict any pathways as in the ERNs, all phones can be recognized if we have a perfect APM. Experiments show that our method achieves an accuracy of 83.3% and a correctness of 88.5%.

In this paper, we study how to compete with the state-of-the-art DNN/HMM method under the traditional GMM/HMM framework. Instead of using DNN as acoustic model, we use DNN as a front-end bottleneck (BN) feature extraction method to decorrelate long feature vectors concatenated from several consecutive speech frames. More importantly, we have proposed two novel incoherent training methods to explicitly de-correlate BN features in learning of DNN. The first method relies on minimizing coherence of weight matrices in DNN while the second one attempts to minimize correlation coefficients of BN features calculated in each mini-batch data in DNN training. Experimental results on a 70-hr Mandarin transcription task and the 309-hr Switchboard task have shown that the traditional GMM/HMMs using BN features can yield comparable performance as DNN/HMM.

Peer-led SI sessions integrate features of subject- and problem-based learning to foster a supportive learning community. SI has not only facilitated the learning of course material but also promoted a spirit of inquiry and a culture of joyful learning. The learning outcomes show that SI has made a positive impact on studentspsila learning, which in turn has helped to increase engineering retention.

Among their programs, OTF creates hands on learning opportunities for students and people interested in marine science, technology and education. This paper will describe opportunities and experiences of an undergraduate student, Jenna Carlson, from the University of Connecticut (UConn), who works closely with OTF in education and outreach coordination. These hands-on learning opportunities and internships provide vital experiences to students like Jenna that will influence their career decisions in the future. For example, OTF and UConn in cooperation with Zoomarine, a marine park and education facility in the Algarve of Portugal, have established a study abroad internship program. Students are able to participate as interns and work closely with marine mammal trainers in all aspects of their daily jobs. As an intern, Jenna participated in training, medical procedures, feeding and daily maintenance of seven Bottlenose dolphins at Zoomarine. As another example, OTF sponsors a Science, Education and Marine Archeology Program in Portugal (SEMAPP). In April 2004 a SEMAPP expedition was conducted using the Delta submersible. Jenna assisted OTF with much of the planning and preparation for the expedition and played a critical role in carrying out education and outreach aspects of the program. This included working with Portuguese high school students on the research vessel, planning a daily schedule for the students, and creating hands-on learning activities. The experiences here created an exciting opportunity for Jenna, as she is the first U.S. undergraduate student to make a deep-sea dive in Portugal. In addition to her role with education and outreach coordination, Jenna was exposed to the disciplines of marine archeology, marine technology, fisheries ecology and marine geology, as well as presenting at national conferences and the opportunity to network with educators and scientists working in these disciplines. On a personal level, the opportunity provided guidance in Jenna's decisions about a professional career.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.2005.1640105","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1640105","","Marine technology;Educational programs;Engineering profession;Oceans;Educational technology;Dolphins;Underwater vehicles;Educational institutions;Aquaculture;Environmental factors","physics education;oceanography","hands-on learning opportunities;Ocean Technology Foundation;marine education;ocean exploration;marine research;underwater activities;marine science;marine technology;University of Connecticut;Zoomarine;marine park;Algarve;study abroad internship program;Bottlenose dolphins;Science Education and Marine Archeology Program in Portugal;SEMAPP expedition;AD 2004 04;Delta submersible;marine archeology;fisheries;ecology;marine geology","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After deep analyzing the properties of top-rank-k frequent patterns, we propose an efficient algorithm called FAE to mining top-rank-k frequent patterns.

During the mining process of FAE, the undesired patterns are filtered and useful patterns are selected to generate other longer potential frequent patterns.

To enhance the ability of the generative model to tackle discriminative computer vision tasks (e.g. image classification), we propose a hierarchical deconvolutional network with two biologically inspired properties incorporated, i.e., non-negative sparsity and selectivity. First, we propose a single layer deconvolutional model with a raw image as input, attempting to decompose the input as a weighted sum of feature maps convolving with filters. Here, the filters are the model parameters common to all the inputs, while the feature maps and the summing weights are specific to the input. The non-negative sparsity is formulated as the /i-norm regularizer on the feature map, which is used to generate feature representations for image classification. And the selectivity is forced on the filters to make different filters active different inputs, through requiring the sparsity on the summing weights specifically. The two properties are summarized into an overall cost function, which can be solved with an alternatively iterative algorithm. Then, we build multiple layer deconvolutional network by stacking the single models, where the next-layer inputs are the results of a 3D max-pooling operation on the inferred feature maps of the front layer, and train the network in a greedy layer wise scheme. Finally, we explore the feature maps of each layer to generate the image representations and input them to a SVM classifier for the classification task. Experiments on two image benchmark datasets of Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 demonstrate the encouraging performance of our model compared with other deep feature learning models as well as some hand-designed features.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977448","","Feature extraction;Image reconstruction;Biological system modeling;Image representation;Computational modeling;Convolutional codes;Training","computer vision;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence)","regularized hierarchical feature learning;nonnegative sparsity;image classification;hierarchical image representation;hand designed features;computer vision;feature maps;feature representations;cost function;deconvolutional network;single models;image benchmark datasets","","1","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we present a highly scalable architecture for Deep Belief Net processing on hardware systems that can handle hundreds of boards, if not more, of customized logic with near linear performance increase. We elucidate tradeoffs between flexibility in the neuron connections, and the hardware resources, such as memory and communication bandwidth, required to build a custom processor design that has optimal efficiency. We illustrate how our architecture can easily support sparse networks with dense regions of connections between neighboring sets of neurons, which is relevant to applications where there are obvious spatial correlations in the data, such as in image processing.

To address this problem, we describe WebIQ, a solution that learns from both the Surface Web and the Deep Web to automatically discover instances for interface attributes. WebIQ extends question answering techniques commonly used in the AI community for this purpose. We describe how to incorporate WebIQ into current interface matching systems.

Meanwhile, a novel way by combining multiple Neural Networks in doing the work is proposed which proves to be able to improve the recognition rate significantly. This method reports a 0.64% error rate on a large test set over 10,000 samples and outperforms traditional methods using hand-crafted features and convolutional neural network committees (another deep learning model), narrowing the gap to human performance.","","","10.1109/ICPR.2014.518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6977230","Chinese Legal Amount;Isolated Character Recognition;Sparse Auto-encoder;Elastic Meshing;Committee","Feature extraction;Training;Character recognition;Neural networks;Error analysis;Law","cheque processing;handwritten character recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets","handwritten character recognition;handwritten Chinese legal amount recognition;stacked autoencoder;pattern recognition;machine learning;automatic check preprocessing;bank check;deep learning;multiple neural network;hand-crafted feature;convolutional neural network committees","","7","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Convolutional sparse coding explicitly models local interactions through the convolution operator, however the resulting optimization problem is considerably more complex than traditional sparse coding.

We investigate the relevance of foreign data characteristics, in particular domain and language. Using three different datasets of the MediaParl and Ester databases, our experiments suggest that domain and language are equally important. Foreign data recorded under matched conditions (language and domain) yields the most improvement. The resulting ASR system yields about 5% relative improvement compared to the baseline system only trained on transcribed data.

Challenges are presented in the form of complex variations of lightings, poses, viewpoints, blurring effects, image resolutions, camera settings, occlusions and background clutter across camera views. In addition, misalignment introduced by the pedestrian detector will affect most existing person re-identification methods that use manually cropped pedestrian images and assume perfect detection. In this paper, we propose a novel filter pairing neural network (FPNN) to jointly handle misalignment, photometric and geometric transforms, occlusions and background clutter. All the key components are jointly optimized to maximize the strength of each component when cooperating with others. In contrast to existing works that use handcrafted features, our method automatically learns features optimal for the re-identification task from data. The learned filter pairs encode photometric transforms. Its deep architecture makes it possible to model a mixture of complex photometric and geometric transforms. We build the largest benchmark re-id dataset with 13, 164 images of 1, 360 pedestrians. Unlike existing datasets, which only provide manually cropped pedestrian images, our dataset provides automatically detected bounding boxes for evaluation close to practical applications.

The set of simpler surfaces has the property that each element of the set can be efficiently modeled by a single feedforward neural network. The degree to which the regression surface is partitioned is controlled by an external scale parameter. The SSGE consists of a nonlinear gating network and several competing nonlinear experts. Although SSGE is similar to the mixture of experts model of Jacobs et al. (1991) the mixture of experts model gives only one partitioning of the input-output space, and thus a single set of features, whereas the SSGE gives the user the capability to discover families of features. One obtains a new member of the family of features for each setting of the scale parameter. We derive the scale-sensitive gated experts and demonstrate its performance on a time series segmentation problem. The main results are: (1) the scale parameter controls the granularity of the features of the regression surface, (2) similar features are modeled by the same expert and different kinds of features are modeled by different experts, and (3) for the time series problem, the SSGE finds different regimes of behavior, each with a specific and interesting interpretation.","","","10.1109/34.817407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817407","","Data mining;Data analysis;Neural networks;Jacobian matrices;Feature extraction;Feedforward neural networks;Predictive models;Entropy;Cost function","data mining;feedforward neural nets;time series;probability;statistical analysis;pattern classification;learning (artificial intelligence)","scale-sensitive gated experts;exploratory data analysis;complex nonlinear regression surface;nonlinear gating network;competing nonlinear experts;mixture of experts model;time series segmentation problem;granularity","","17","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, precise assessments must take into account the fact that the requirements for the given quality level are service-dependent. The backbone QoS monitoring and analysis requires processing of large amounts of data and knowledge of which kinds of applications the traffic is generated by. To overcome the drawbacks of existing methods for traffic classification, we proposed and evaluated a centralized solution based on the C5.0 Machine Learning Algorithm (MLA) and decision rules. The first task was to collect and to provide to C5.0 high-quality training data divided into groups, which correspond to different types of applications. It was found that the currently existing means of collecting data (classification by ports, Deep Packet Inspection, statistical classification, public data sources) are not sufficient and they do not comply with the required standards. We developed a new system to collect training data, in which the major role is performed by volunteers. Client applications installed on volunteers' computers collect the detailed data about each flow passing through the network interface, together with the application name taken from the description of system sockets. This paper proposes a new method for measuring the level of Quality of Service in broadband networks. It is based on our Volunteer-Based System to collect the training data, Machine Learning Algorithms to generate the classification rules and the application-specific rules for assessing the QoS level. We combine both passive and active monitoring technologies. The paper evaluates different possibilities of implementation, presents the current implementation of particular parts of the system, their initial runs and the obtained results, highlighting parts relevant from the QoS point of view.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6488383","broadband networks;data collecting;Machine Learning Algorithms;performance monitoring;Quality of Service;traffic classification;volunteer-based system","Quality of service;Internet;Servers;Data processing","broadband networks;Internet;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;statistical analysis","quality of service;computer networks;high-speed Internet infrastructures;QoS monitoring;traffic classification;C5.0 Machine Learning Algorithm;MLA;decision rules;C5.0 high-quality training data;Deep Packet Inspection;statistical classification;public data sources;network interface;system sockets;broadband networks;volunteer-based system;application-specific rules;active monitoring technologies","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We bridge this gap by introducing randomized Multi- Layer Perceptrons (rMLP) as new split nodes which are capable of learning non-linear, data-specific representations and taking advantage of them by finding optimal predictions for the emerging child nodes. To prevent overfitting, we i) randomly select the image data fed to the input layer, ii) automatically adapt the rMLP topology to meet the complexity of the data arriving at the node and iii) introduce an l1-norm based regularization that additionally sparsifies the network.

The aim of this paper is to bridge the gap between technology and education, because the reasons for this failure are many and quite complex. Indeed, solving this problem is urgent as education is in the following predicament: (a) most of the teachers do not possess science knowledge deep enough in order to teach science and technology properly while (b) modern society needs individuals possessing a broad general education, good communication skills, adaptability, and a commitment to lifelong learning. ICT technology, on the other hand, is mature and cheap enough and it might, represent the only obvious solution to the science teaching problem and to lifelong learning scenarios. Despite all these, education and technology do not easily mix together. Although new software products are produced continually, teachers are unwilling to put them into immediate use. This might be because the crucial bridge between education and technology is still missing. Teachers do not know what is available, while technology ignores teacher's needs. This paper is an attempt to bring these two sides closer. Issues faced by educationalists when trying to incorporate ICT in teaching and learning are presented herein. These should really be the main points on which designers of computer-based learning environments should focus on. The ultimate aim of the present study is to assist the understanding and mutual cooperation between system designers and educationalists, so as to improve product quality and in-class effectiveness.","","","10.1109/IWSSIP.2007.4381181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4381181","ICT based education;construction and implementation of computer based learning environments;educational environment;science teaching;science education;life long learning;teacher's needs from technology","Educational technology;Computer science education;Educational institutions;Bridges;Educational products;Continuing professional development;Writing;History;Geography;Europe","computer aided instruction;continuing professional development;educational institutions;natural sciences computing;teaching","science education;schools;teaching;lifelong learning;ICT technology;computer-based learning environment;digital technology","","","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study aims at speeding up Hessian-free training, both by means of decreasing the amount of data used for training, as well as through reduction of the number of Krylov subspace solver iterations used for implicit estimation of the Hessian. In this paper, we develop an L-BFGS based preconditioning scheme that avoids the need to access the Hessian explicitly. Since L-BFGS cannot be regarded as a fixed-point iteration, we further propose the employment of flexible Krylov subspace solvers that retain the desired theoretical convergence guarantees of their conventional counterparts. Second, we propose a new sampling algorithm, which geometrically increases the amount of data utilized for gradient and Krylov subspace iteration calculations. On a 50-hr English Broadcast News task, we find that these methodologies provide roughly a 1.5× speed-up, whereas, on a 300-hr Switchboard task, these techniques provide over a 2.3× speedup, with no loss in WER. These results suggest that even further speed-up is expected, as problems scale and complexity grows.","","","10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707747","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707747","","Training;Hafnium;Optimization;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms;Equations;Mathematical model","iterative methods;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;optimisation;speech recognition","Hessian-free optimization;implicit preconditioning;implicit sampling;Hessian-free training;parallel second order optimization technique;deep neural network training;Krylov subspace solver iterations;implicit Hessian estimation;L-BFGS based preconditioning scheme;fixed-point iteration;50-hr English broadcast news task;300-hr Switchboard task;speech recognition","","1","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A particularly general example of an order-statistic non-linearity is the “sortout” non-linearity, which outputs all input activations, but in sorted order. Such Order-statistic networks (OSNs), in contrast with other recently proposed generalizations of Maxout networks, leave the determination of the interpolation weights on the activations to the network, and remain conditionally linear given the input, and so are well suited for powerful model aggregation techniques such as dropout, drop connect, and annealed dropout.

The necessary computational effort, though, is likely to increase when DeEPs is applied to a large database. Our proposed classifier operates on the nearest neighbors of a test instance. This reduction of instances improves scalability as the database volume increases. Moreover, our classifier imposes a restriction regarding JEPs discovery, so that it excludes patterns that cannot be identified as either correct JEPs or JEPs caused by the maximal patterns missing from nearest neighbors. These probably incorrect JEPs are specialized with additional items and participate in class determination.

"Top-Down Segmentation of Non-rigid Visual Objects Using Derivative-Based Search on Sparse Manifolds","J. C. Nascimento; G. Carneiro","NA; NA","2013 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","","2013","","","1963","1970","The solution for the top-down segmentation of non rigid visual objects using machine learning techniques is generally regarded as too complex to be solved in its full generality given the large dimensionality of the search space of the explicit representation of the segmentation contour. In order to reduce this complexity, the problem is usually divided into two stages: rigid detection and non-rigid segmentation. The rationale is based on the fact that the rigid detection can be run in a lower dimensionality space (i.e., less complex and faster) than the original contour space, and its result is then used to constrain the non-rigid segmentation. In this paper, we propose the use of sparse manifolds to reduce the dimensionality of the rigid detection search space of current state-of-the-art top-down segmentation methodologies. The main goals targeted by this smaller dimensionality search space are the decrease of the search running time complexity and the reduction of the training complexity of the rigid detector. These goals are attainable given that both the search and training complexities are function of the dimensionality of the rigid search space. We test our approach in the segmentation of the left ventricle from ultrasound images and lips from frontal face images. Compared to the performance of state-of-the-art non-rigid segmentation system, our experiments show that the use of sparse manifolds for the rigid detection leads to the two goals mentioned above.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2013.256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6619100","Non-rigid top-down segmentation;deep belief network;manifold learning","Manifolds;Training;Image segmentation;Complexity theory;Visualization;Vectors;Search problems","computational complexity;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence)","state-of-the-art nonrigid segmentation system;frontal face images;ultrasound images;search complexity;rigid detector;training complexity;running time complexity;dimensionality search space;segmentation methodology;rigid detection search space;contour space;dimensionality space;segmentation contour;explicit representation;machine learning techniques;non rigid visual objects;sparse manifolds;derivative-based search;non-rigid visual objects;top-down segmentation","","2","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Deep Impact launched the flight system, consisting of two spacecraft, on January 12, 2005 for an Encounter with comet Tempel 1 just 6 months later. The two spacecraft, known as the Flyby and the Impactor, were separated 24 hours prior to Encounter, whereby the Impactor targeted itself to a collision course with Tempel 1 and the Flyby captured the event as it flew by the comet. Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation (BATC) located in Boulder, CO. was the system contractor for the Deep Impact spacecraft. BATC also developed the DI Test Benches. Test benches are developed by a flight project to provide an effective platform for developing flight software and mission sequences, to offload the flight system for pre-launch validation and verification efforts, and to reliably represent the flight system for development and anomaly resolution post-launch. The success of Deep Impact was heavily reliant on these valuable project resources.

Motivated by theories of perception, the model consists of two interacting pathways, identity and control, intended to mirror the what and where pathways in neuroscience models. The identity pathway models object appearance and performs classification using deep (factored)-restricted Boltzmann machines. At each point in time, the observations consist of foveated images, with decaying resolution toward the periphery of the gaze. The control pathway models the location, orientation, scale, and speed of the attended object. The posterior distribution of these states is estimated with particle filtering. Deeper in the control pathway, we encounter an attentional mechanism that learns to select gazes so as to minimize tracking uncertainty. Unlike in our previous work, we introduce gaze selection strategies that operate in the presence of partial information and on a continuous action space. We show that a straightforward extension of the existing approach to the partial information setting results in poor performance, and we propose an alternative method based on modeling the reward surface as a gaussian process. This approach gives good performance in the presence of partial information and allows us to expand the action space from a small, discrete set of fixation points to a continuous domain.","","","10.1162/NECO_a_00312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6797317","","","","","","20","","","","","","MITP",""

The proliferation of virtualization creates a new technique for the detection of such attacks. In this paper, we propose to design a rootkit detection mechanism for virtual machines through deep information extracting and reconstruction at the hypervisor level. Through accessing the important components of a VM such as the kernel symbol table, the hypervisor can reconstruct the VM's execution states and learn the essential information such as the running processes, active network connections, and opened files. Through cross-verification among the different components of the reconstructed execution states of the VM, we can detect both the hidden information and the anomaly connections among them. We implement our approach in Xen 4.1 with Linux VMs. Our experiments show that the hypervisor can efficiently reconstruct the semantic view of a VM's memory and identify the rootkits. Since the hypervisor accesses only the high level data structures, it has very limited impacts on the performance of VM.","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682767","","Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Kernel;Malware;Semantics;Linux;Image reconstruction","invasive software;Linux;virtual machines;virtualisation","rootkit detection;virtual machines;deep information extraction;stealth attacks detection;malware detection;virtualization;deep information reconstruction;hypervisor level;VM components;kernel symbol table;Xen 4.1;Linux VM","","2","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To further reduce the computational costs, feature selection is applied to simplify the networks and two optimization methods are used during the online tracking process.

As a consequence, humans are used to integrate at each instant perceptions from all their senses in order to enrich their understanding of the surrounding world. This paradigm can be also extremely useful in many signal processing and computer vision problems involving mutually related signals. The simultaneous processing of multimodal data can, in fact, reveal information that is otherwise hidden when considering the signals independently. However, in natural multimodal signals, the statistical dependencies between modalities are in general not obvious. Learning fundamental multimodal patterns could offer deep insight into the structure of such signals. In this paper, we present a novel model of multimodal signals based on their sparse decomposition over a dictionary of multimodal structures. An algorithm for iteratively learning multimodal generating functions that can be shifted at all positions in the signal is proposed, as well. The learning is defined in such a way that it can be accomplished by iteratively solving a generalized eigenvector problem, which makes the algorithm fast, flexible, and free of user-defined parameters. The proposed algorithm is applied to audiovisual sequences and it is able to discover underlying structures in the data. The detection of such audio-video patterns in audiovisual clips allows to effectively localize the sound source on the video in presence of substantial acoustic and visual distractors, outperforming state-of-the-art audiovisual localization algorithms.","","","10.1109/TIP.2007.901813","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4287000","Audiovisual source localization;dictionary learning;multimodal data processing;sparse representation","Dictionaries;Signal processing;Signal processing algorithms;Iterative algorithms;Signal analysis;Magnetic analysis;Humans;Satellite broadcasting;Image sensors;Magnetic sensors","eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;iterative methods;signal classification","natural multimodal signals;sparse multimodal signal decomposition;iterative learning;eigenvector problem;audiovisual sequences;audio-video patterns","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Dictionaries as Topic;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Information Storage and Retrieval;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Subtraction Technique","27","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While the benefits of project based learning approaches are clear, there are a number of challenges in establishing and maintaining the deep level of institutional and industrial interaction required to create a successful program. This paper discusses several approaches adopted by the Project Based Learning Institute (PBLI) in developing project-centered relationships with external organizations. PBLI serves as an academic incubator that has been used to overcome institutional inertia by creating a structure that lies outside existing well-established ldquoterritoriesrdquo. It discusses the self supporting nature of the approach, which allows resource issues which typically shackle initiatives to be obviated. It describes how the program has developed into a catalyst for industry participation that benefits both students and corporate sponsors. It describes the how the juxtaposition of high-potential faculty, coupled with incentives for multi-disciplinary faculty collaboration, enrichess the educational experience for students. The outcome is underpinned by vehicles that couple industry interests to university resources.

Features are extracted for each frame based on the relative positions of joints (PO), temporal differences (TD), and normalized trajectories of motion (NT). Given these features a hybrid multi-layer perceptron is trained, which simultaneously classifies and reconstructs input data. We use deep autoencoder to visualize learnt features. The experiments show that deep neural networks can capture more discriminative information than, for instance, principal component analysis can.

While various biclustering algorithms (e.g., combinatorial, probabilistic modelling, and matrix factorization) have been proposed and constantly improved in the past decade, data noise and bicluster overlaps make biclustering a still challenging task. It becomes difficult to further improve biclustering performance, without resorting to a new approach. Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning using deep neural networks, in this work, we propose a novel model for biclustering, named Auto Decoder (AD), by relating biclusters to features and leveraging a neural network that is able to automatically learn features from the input data. To suppress severe noise present in gene expression data, we introduce a non-uniform signal recovery mechanism: Instead of reconstructing the whole input data to capture the bicluster patterns, AD weighs the zero and non-zero parts of the input data differently and is more flexible in dealing with different types of noise. AD is also properly regularized to deal with bicluster overlaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first biclustering algorithm that leverages neural network techniques to recover overlapped biclusters hidden in noisy gene expression data. We compared our approach with four state-of-the-art biclustering algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. On three out of the four real datasets, AD significantly outperforms the other approaches. On controlled synthetic datasets, AD performs the best when noise level is beyond 15%.","","","10.1109/ICDM.2013.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6729555","Gene Expression;Biclustering;Neural Network","Noise;Gene expression;Neural networks;Neurons;Algorithm design and analysis;Robustness;Noise level","biology computing;genetics;neural nets;pattern clustering;pattern recognition;unsupervised learning","noise-resistant bicluster recognition;co-expressed genes;biclustering algorithms;unsupervised feature learning;deep neural networks;AutoDecoder;automatic feature learning;noise suppression;nonuniform signal recovery mechanism;bicluster patterns;AD;overlapped bicluster recovery;noisy gene expression data;synthetic datasets;real datasets","","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The loss of ambulation (LoA) is a functional milestone of DMD progression and the age at LoA is often used as an indication of disease severity. But as age at LoA is not always available, such as when patients remain ambulant at study end, its use has been limited. In this paper, we report machine learning approaches to predict age at LoA based on clinical measures of muscular strength and motor function, and validate the algorithms using the CINRG dataset. With extensive experiments and rigorous statistical analysis, we found that (1) the utilization of multiple clinical features yields better prediction than using any of the single measures, and (2) the prediction based on Lasso is more accurate than other multivariate analytical approaches such as ordinary least squares and ridge regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to provide point predictions for age at LoA in DMD using clinical phenotypic measures. Importantly, we find that not all clinical measures contribute to the prediction. Age at the last visit (before LoA), velocity of walking 10 meters, and velocity of climbing 4 steps are selected as important predictors by Lasso. The usefulness of the prediction model is illustrated with evidence that the association between a well-known modifier of DMD severity and age at LoA has better power when the predicted values are utilized.","","","10.1109/GlobalSIP.2014.7032343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7032343","","Predictive models;Diseases;Data models;Accuracy;Drugs;Numerical models;Loss measurement","diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;medical disorders;muscle;statistical analysis","age prediction;loss of ambulation;LoA;Duchenne muscular dystrophy;DMD;clinical phenotypic measure;single-gene lethal disorder;machine learning;statistical analysis","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of our key contributions is to propose a Switchable Restricted Boltzmann Machine (SRBM) to explicitly model the complex mixture of visual variations at multiple levels. At the feature levels, it automatically estimates saliency maps for each test sample in order to separate background clutters from discriminative regions for pedestrian detection. At the part and body levels, it is able to infer the most appropriate template for the mixture models of each part and the whole body.

In this framework, a deformable part-based model is used to obtain the scores of part detectors and the visibilities of parts are modeled as hidden variables. Unlike previous occlusion handling approaches that assume independence among visibility probabilities of parts or manually define rules for the visibility relationship, a discriminative deep model is used in this paper for learning the visibility relationship among overlapping parts at multiple layers.

The core part of the Deep LM is the traditional back-propagation (BP) algorithm. However, it takes so much time to learn by the Deep LM because of its additional processes to realize the fault tolerance. Furthermore, there is an additional process such that SECDED code is used to detect or correct the neuron faults in the output layer. To cope with this, the hot-spots in using the Deep LM and the outline of their CUDA C source codes, including the auto-tuning process in the hot-spots, are shown.

In this paper, we propose a sophisticated machine learning based approach to statically predict the recursion frequency of functions for programs in real-world application domains, which can be used to guide various hot spot optimizations. Our experiments with 369 programs of 25 benchmark suites from different domains demonstrate that our approach is applicable to a wide range of programs with different behavior and yields more precise heuristics than those generated by pure static analyses.

The deep recursion of MDLCompress combined with its two-part coding nature makes it uniquely able to identify biologically meaningful sequence without limiting assumptions. The ability to quantify cost in bits for phrases in the MDL model promotes prediction of fragile regions where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may have the most impact on biological activity.

Though many methods have been developed to acquire textual semantics, the acquisition of deep textual semantics is still a challenge issue. Herein, the acquisition method of deep textual semantics is developed to enhance the capability of text understanding of machine, including two parts:1) how to obtain and organize the domain knowledge extracted from domain text set; 2) how to stimulate the domain knowledge for obtaining the deep textual semantics. The activation process involves two cognitive mechanisms; one is the Landscape model and the other is human memory system model. The former model is a human reading model. The later model describes the memory change in the text reading process. Generalized semantic field is proposed to store the domain knowledge as the form of Long Time Memory (LTM). Specialized semantic field, which is acquired by the interaction between the text fragment and the domain knowledge, is introduced to describe the change process of textual semantics. By their mutual actions, we can get the deep textual semantics which enhances the capability of text understanding of machine; therefore, the machine can understand the text more precisely and correctly than those methods which only obtain surface textual semantics.","","","10.1109/COGINF.2011.6016154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6016154","semantic field;domain knowledge;landscape model;cognitive mechanism;reading process","Semantics;Psychology;Brain modeling;Surface treatment;Artificial neural networks;Tin;Humans","cognition;data acquisition;knowledge representation languages;semantic Web;text analysis","textual semantics acquisition;domain knowledge;e-learning;Web search;Web services;cognitive mechanism;landscape model;human memory system model;human reading model;text reading process;generalized semantic field;long time memory;surface semantics","","2","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent trends in deep learning, however, have pointed out that data-driven features learning performs better designed features in some tasks, since they can capture the global (via multi-layers network) or inter-local structures (convolutional network) of images. We argue that combining the two types of features can significantly improve visual object recognition performance. We propose in this paper a framework that uses sparse coding and the fusion of learned and designed features in order to build descriptive codewords.

One of the most popular learning formulations of data structure processing is backpropagation through structure (BPTS). The BPTS algorithm has been successful applied to a number of learning tasks that involve structural patterns such as logo and natural scene classification. The main limitations of the BPTS algorithm are attributed to slow convergence speed and the long-term dependency problem for the adaptive processing of data structures. In this paper, an improved algorithm is proposed to solve these problems. The idea of this algorithm is to optimize the free learning parameters of the neural network in the node representation by using least-squares-based optimization methods in a layer-by-layer fashion. Not only can fast convergence speed be achieved, but the long-term dependency problem can also be overcome since the vanishing of gradient information is avoided when our approach is applied to very deep tree structures.","","","10.1109/TNN.2003.813831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1215396","","Data structures;Backpropagation algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Neural networks;Convergence;Optimization methods;Neurons;Layout;Tree data structures;Artificial neural networks","data structures;neural nets;backpropagation;optimisation;least squares approximations;convergence","long-term dependency problems;adaptive processing;data structures;neural-network representations;backpropagation through structure;learning tasks;structural patterns;slow convergence speed;free learning parameters;node representation;least-squares-based optimization methods","","25","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Effective connectivity, defined as the influence one neuronal system exerts over another, can provide deep understanding of directed influence between brain regions in the network from the view of functional integration. Granger causality analysis is one of the conventional approaches to explore the effective connectivity in brain imaging researches. In this study, we applied Granger causality analysis to resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from 12 young subjects to explore the effective connectivity pattern of the DMN. The results demonstrated that posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and inferior parietal cortex (IPC) were the only three regions had significant causal relationship with all other regions in more than 50% subjects and PCC was the only brain area influenced by all others while had no directed influence to others. The strong effective connectivity pattern demonstrated that PCC, MPFC and IPC were the three key regions and PCC was the convergence hub in the network.

A whole network can then be trained (fine-tuned) in a supervised fashion. One possible pre-training strategy is to regard each hidden layer in the network as the input layer of an auto-encoder. Since auto-encoders aim to reconstruct their own input, their training must be based on some cost function capable of measuring reconstruction performance. Similarly, the supervised fine-tuning of a deep network needs to be based on some cost function that reflects prediction performance. In this work we compare different combinations of cost functions in terms of their impact on layer-wise reconstruction performance and on supervised classification performance of deep networks. We employed two classic functions, namely the cross-entropy (CE) cost and the sum of squared errors (SSE), as well as the exponential (EXP) cost, inspired by the error entropy concept.

Traditional ways of learning to operate such neurosurgery can be non-intuitive, costly, highly pressured, and time limited. With the development of virtual reality technology, such issues may be resolved. Immersive virtual environments use a stereoscopic head-mounted display and data glove to create high fidelity virtual experiences. Users can interact with three-dimensional models by peering over/in/through the object and perceive relationships at their true scale. This stands in contrast to traditional computer-aided infrastructure in which images are viewed as stacks of two-dimensional slices, or, at best, disembodied renderings. Various data sources such as video and audio could also be integrated into the environment to enrich the available information. Despite substantial innovation for entertainment and consumer media, applications of immersive virtual environment technologies in medical applications remain yet to be explored. In this paper, we consider potential applications of such technologies for deep brain stimulation patients with brain magnetic resonance imaging data. Our environment allows users to view brain scans at scale and interact with virtual models including anatomical structures and neural fiber tracts using a data glove. Micro-electrode recordings, stored as wav sound files, are integrated into the system, which permits the user to learn the different patterns of neuronal firing at different brain location.

The use of deep belief networks is justified because of its ability to learn robust models with few annotated images and its flexibility that allowed us to adapt it to a top-down segmentation problem. We demonstrate that our method produces competitive results using the database of the MICCAI grand challenge on left ventricle segmentation from cardiac MRI images, where our methodology produces results on par with the best in the field in each one of the measures used in that challenge (perpendicular distance, Dice metric, and percentage of good detections).

This research examines a segmented look at mammograms for computer aided detection with the goal of reliably labeling regions of interest requiring the attention of a radiologist. Classification is achieved by employing the building blocks, namely unsupervised clustering, of a deep learning architecture in tandem with a standard feed-forward neural network. Early results show promise for creating a classification engine that handles high-dimensional data with minimum engineering of image features, with a high per-image patch sensitivity and specificity.

In a brief few years of submersible operations pilots and observers have learned the limitations of view port vision and a few have observed the maximum effectiveness obtained through transparent hulls (Sea-Link, Nemo, Kumukahi). As time continues and experience builds the glass and glass-ceramic transparent hulls continue to appear as the next step for going deeper. The difficulties in using presently available glass are due to the present low quality, brittleness and the physical properties mismatch with other high strength materials. Techniques for quantitative stress analysis were developed and comparative experiments with numerous glass to metal joints were conducted until the final design was obtained. The various subsystems are briefly described as well as the sequential testing of the pressure hull, environmental propulsion, etc. and test operations to date.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.1971.1161062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1161062","","Glass;Underwater vehicles;Surface treatment;Surface cracks;Costs;Plastics;Testing;Tensile stress;Contracts;Safety","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proliferation of digital cameras and the growing photo sharing using current technology for browsing such collections, but at the same time it spurred the emergence of new image retrieval techniques based not only on photos' visual information, but on geo-location tags. Currently image retrieval systems; the retrieval process is performed using similarity strategies applied on certain features in the image. In this paper, we proposed a process of image refining retrieval result by exploiting and fusing unsupervised feature technique Principal component analysis (PCA) and spectral clustering. PCA algorithm is used for to remove the outliers from the initially retrieved image set, and then it uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract principal components of the feature values. Later on, feature values of each image are exhibited by a linear combination of these principal components. Spectral clustering analyzes retrieval process by clustering together visually similar images. PCA and spectral clustering require manual turning of their parameters, which usually requires a priori knowledge of the dataset. To overcome this problem we developed a tuning mechanism that automatically tunes the parameters of both algorithms. For the evaluation of the proposed approach we used thousands of images from Flickr downloaded using text queries for well-known cultural heritage monuments. The proposed method was performed and tested on a set of images from variant sceneries. Experimental results show the superior performance of this approach.","","","10.1109/ICCWAMTIP.2014.7073406","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7073406","Image retrieval;Image clustering;Principal Component Analysis;Spectral clustering","Principal component analysis;Visualization;Image retrieval;Computer science;Clustering algorithms;Cultural differences;Covariance matrices","feature extraction;history;image retrieval;pattern clustering;principal component analysis;unsupervised learning;Web sites","cultural heritage monument;text query;Flickr;tuning mechanism;spectral clustering;image refining retrieval;PCA;principal component analysis;content based image retrieval;unsupervised feature extraction","","5","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This interest is driven by the desire to maximize the usefulness of existing DSN large apertures in case of spacecraft emergency and to develop the necessary knowledge of how the array of small and distributed reflector antennas can meet other future uplink throughput needs. The primary challenge for uplink arraying of distributed reflector antennas for deep space applications is the lack of feedback from deep space within a reasonably short period. Furthermore, the individual reflectors (and their transmitter subsystems) are thousands of wavelengths apart, which make the phase coherence of individual transmitted signals an extremely challenging task. Because of the return light time constraints, all closed-loop calibrations and relative phase adjustments for any coherent combination of signals from individual antennas be conducted no farther than near-Earth orbits. This paper discusses the large array background, scope, and evolution, and some of the lessons learned from preliminary studies of the uplink array.","","","10.1109/AERO.2004.1367715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1367715","","Antenna arrays;Reflector antennas;Space vehicles;Aperture antennas;Throughput;Antenna feeds;Feedback;Transmitters;Coherence;Time factors","space communication links;antenna arrays;reflector antennas","uplink array system;deep space network;distributed reflector antennas;spacecraft emergency;feedback;transmitter subsystems;phase coherence;return light time constraints;closed loop calibrations;relative phase adjustments;near-Earth orbits","","6","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the speed of convergence is still low and is influenced by the number of sampling, which is represented by the limited availability for the information vector.

While good separation performance is achieved in matched test conditions using kernel support vector machines (SVMs), separation in unmatched conditions involving new speakers and environments remains a big challenge. A simple yet effective method to cope with the mismatch is to include many different acoustic conditions into the training set. However, large-scale training is almost intractable for kernel machines due to computational complexity. To enable training on relatively large datasets, we propose to learn more linearly separable and discriminative features from raw acoustic features and train linear SVMs, which are much easier and faster to train than kernel SVMs. For feature learning, we employ standard pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs). The proposed DNN-SVM system is trained on a variety of acoustic conditions within a reasonable amount of time.

These ports are those often marked by firewall administrators as “safe” or those given a higher priority on quality of service systems. This problem has been effectively managed by implementing deep packet inspection techniques, giving the administrators a view into the underlying layer 7 protocol of each flow. The reliance on transit payload to be in plain text format in order to reliably match the underlying content has put this method of classification at a major disadvantage. The use of encryption by users to render the contents of a data packet opaque is, therefore, of major concern to network administrators who rely heavily on deep packet inspection. Without the ability to interrogate the underlying payload of traffic flows, a new method to identify this type of traffic needs to be discovered in order to retain control of the network. As an increasing number of users turn to IP tunneling to secure their data transfers, network service providers need to ensure their systems are ready to handle this type of traffic. A failure to do so would result in them facing the reality of a badly managed network. This paper highlights the challenges faced by network service providers in opaque traffic classification for both existing and future, next generation networks. It investigates and evaluates the various solutions implemented in order to manage network traffic “in the dark”.","","","10.1109/ISSA.2011.6027529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6027529","Network Flow Classification;Deep Packet Inspection;Encryption;VPN;Service Providers;IPv6","Protocols;Machine learning algorithms;Internet;Payloads;IP networks;Encryption","computer network security;cryptography;Internet;IP networks;quality of service;telecommunication traffic","traffic flow management;next generation service provider network;quality of service system;deep packet inspection technique;encryption;data packet opaque;IP tunneling;opaque traffic classification","","","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In its simplest form, a discriminative model is trained as a time-frequency masking function, where the training target is an ideal mask. Ideal masks, such as the ideal binary masks, are structured spectro-temporal patterns. However, previous formulations do not model prominent output structure. In this paper, we propose an alternative training target that is explicitly related to mask structure. We first learn a compositional model of the square-root ideal ratio mask that is closely related to the Wiener filter. Instead of directly estimating the ideal mask values, we learn to predict the weights for resulting mask-level spectro-temporal bases, which are then used to generate the estimated masks. In other words, the discriminative model is used to predict the parameters of a generative model of the target of interest. Experimental results show consistent improvements in low SNR conditions by adopting the new training target.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854777","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854777","Speech separation;deep neural networks;training target;spectro-temporal patterns","Speech;Training;Spectrogram;Noise measurement;Signal to noise ratio;Speech enhancement","learning (artificial intelligence);source separation;speech intelligibility;speech processing;Wiener filters","structure-preserving training target;supervised learning based speech separation;discriminative model;time-frequency masking function;ideal binary masks;structured spectrotemporal patterns;mask structure;compositional model;square-root ideal ratio mask;Wiener filter;ideal mask values;mask-level spectrotemporal bases;generative model;SNR conditions","","11","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this domain, the existing methods usually use only a few labeled samples to classify affective states consisting of over thousands of features. Therefore, important information may not be well utilized and performance is lowered due to the randomness caused by the small sample problem. However, this issue has rarely been discussed in the previous studies. Besides, many EEG channels are irrelevant to the specific learning tasks, which introduce lots of noise to the systems and further lower the performance in the recognition of affective states. To address these two challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Belief Networks (DBN) based model for affective state recognition from EEG signals. Specifically, signals from each EEG channel are firstly processed with a DBN for effectively extracting critical information from the over thousands of features. The extracted low dimensional characteristics are then utilized in the learning to avoid the small sample problem. For the noisy channel problem, a novel stimulus-response model is proposed. The optimal channel set is obtained according to the response rate of each channel. Finally, a supervised Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is applied on the combined low dimensional characteristics from the optimal EEG channels. To evaluate the performance of the proposed Supervised DBN based Affective State Recognition (SDA) model, we implement it on the Deap Dataset and compare it with five baselines. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can successfully handle the aforementioned two challenges and significantly outperform the baselines by 11.5% to 24.4%, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the task of affective state recognition.","","","10.1109/BIBM.2013.6732507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6732507","","Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Support vector machines;Principal component analysis;Data mining;Training","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;electroencephalography;feature extraction;medical signal processing","affective state recognition;EEG;deep belief networks;electroencephalogram;feature extraction;noisy channel problem;stimulus-response model;restricted Boltzmann machine","","27","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Being-with: A study of familiarity","P. Turner","NA","Interacting with Computers","","2008","20","4-5","447","454","How people learn to use an interactive device has always been an important field of research in human–computer interaction (HCI). The theoretical bases of which have ranged from the traditional cognitive perspectives through situated learning to collectivist – social perspectives. Each of these has treated learning to use interactive devices in a typical dualistic manner with a clear distinction between “man and machine”. However, in addition to simply using interactive technologies we also co-exist with them, a relationship which might be called being-with. For many of us, interactive technology has always been there (we are born into a world replete with it) and we have a deep familiarity with it. Familiarity, according to Heidegger, is non-dualistic; it is a fact of our existence, of our worldliness; it is one of the primary ways in which we relate to the world, and offers an alternate basis for thinking about how we learn to use technology. An empirical study of familiarity is presented involving a group of seniors learning to use a personal computer and the services it provides. The analysis of the resultant substantial body of interview and discussion group data lead to the conclusion that to become familiar with technology is to integrate it into one’s everyday life – an everyday life which is correspondingly reconfigured. Specifically, learning to use these technologies is better seen as changing the practices of everyday life to accommodate them. This dimension of being-with potentially has significant consequences for very many aspects of HCI. So, in addition to designing for ease of use; designing for experience perhaps we should now add designing for being-with.","","","10.1016/j.intcom.2008.04.002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8147313","Being-with;Familiarity;Learning;Qualitative analysis;Heidegger;Borgmann","","","","","5","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This heterogeneity raises the necessity of learning the optimal combination of sensor modalities for each activity. On the other hand, users may consistently or occasionally annotate activities. To boost recognition accuracy, we need to incorporate the user input and incrementally adjust the model. To tackle these challenges, we propose an adaptive activity recognition with dynamic heterogeneous sensor fusion framework. We dynamically fuse various modalities to characterize different activities. The model is consistently updated upon arrival of newly labeled data. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we incorporate it into popular feature transformation algorithms, e.g., Linear Discriminant Analysis, Marginal Fisher's Analysis, and Maximum Mutual Information in the proposed framework.

The classification of an input sample is determined by the majority classification by the ensemble. Traditional random forest classifiers can be highly effective, but classification using a random forest is memory bound and not typically suitable for acceleration using FPGAs or GP-GPUs due to the need to traverse large, possibly irregular decision trees. Recent work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has developed several variants of random forest classifiers, including the Compact Random Forest (CRF), that can generate decision trees more suitable for acceleration than traditional decision trees. Our paper compares and contrasts the effectiveness of FPGAs, GP-GPUs, and multi-core CPUs for accelerating classification using models generated by compact random forest machine learning classifiers. Taking advantage of training algorithms that can produce compact random forests composed of many, small trees rather than fewer, deep trees, we are able to regularize the forest such that the classification of any sample takes a deterministic amount of time. This optimization then allows us to execute the classifier in a pipelined or single-instruction multiple thread (SIMT) fashion. We show that FPGAs provide the highest performance solution, but require a multi-chip / multi-board system to execute even modest sized forests. GP-GPUs offer a more flexible solution with reasonably high performance that scales with forest size. Finally, multi-threading via Open MP on a shared memory system was the simplest solution and provided near linear performance that scaled with core count, but was still significantly slower than the GP-GPU and FPGA.","","","10.1109/FCCM.2012.47","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6239820","FPGA;GP-GPU;OpenMP;Machine learning","Vegetation;Field programmable gate arrays;Pipelines;Decision trees;Training;Acceleration;Hardware","decision trees;electronic engineering computing;field programmable gate arrays;learning (artificial intelligence);microprocessor chips;multi-threading;pattern classification;shared memory systems","random forest classifier;GP-GPU;FPGA;machine learning;ensemble;decision tree;majority classification;memory bound;compact random forest;CRF;multicore CPU;training algorithm;single-instruction multiple thread;SIMT;multichip system;multiboard system;forest size;multithreading;open MP;shared memory system;linear performance","","46","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The professional development and understanding of appropriate theories needed to prepare materials and support student learning in these different teaching environments is often left to the academic to pursue independently, if at all. Whilst individual academics who revitalise courses in line with collaborative learning practices have the motivation, personality and teaching skills necessary to facilitate a class or groups of students, it may not be so for additional `tutors' allocated to assist. Their differences in philosophy, personality and skills may have major impacts on the student learning experience. Even where tutors may be experienced academics in their own right, they may not fully understand the rationale and methods being employed and may need skill development. Professional development of academic staff is often overlooked in universities but it is vital for staff to engage in new learning and teaching practices and skill development if collaborative teaching strategies are to be sustained and make a positive contribution to the student learning journey. These factors become even more important as universities move into the online environment where meaningful engagement with the student cohort is significantly more than just making content available and having electronic submission of assignments. This paper describes the development of a strategy to train engineering tutors in online PBL facilitation, and the evaluation framework used to assess the effectiveness of this training. Results of the evaluation of training and subsequent behavioural changes of the tutors are given. The evaluation revealed a variance between the message of the training and subsequent practice.

Part of the challenge stems from the confusion of what the computational goal should be. While the separation of every sound source in a mixture is considered the gold standard, I argue that such an objective is neither realistic nor what the human auditory system does. Motivated by the auditory masking phenomenon, we have suggested instead the ideal time-frequency binary mask as a main goal for computational auditory scene analysis. This leads to a new formulation to speech separation that classifies time-frequency units into two classes: those dominated by the target speech and the rest. In supervised learning, a paramount issue is generalization to conditions unseen during training. I describe novel methods to deal with the generalization issue where support vector machines (SVMs) are used to estimate the ideal binary mask. One method employs distribution fitting to adapt to unseen signal-to-noise ratios and iterative voice activity detection to adapt to unseen noises. Another method learns more linearly separable features using deep neural networks (DNNs) and then couples DNN and linear SVM for training on a variety of noisy conditions. Systematic evaluations show high quality separation in new acoustic environments.","","","10.1109/WASPAA.2013.6701804","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6701804","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this GMDH-type neural network, principal component-regression analysis is used as the learning algorithm of the weights in the GMDH-type neural network which is a type of the deep neural network with many hidden layers. The architecture of the deep neural network with many hidden layers is automatically organized using the heuristic self-organization method, so as to minimize the prediction error criterion defined as Akaike's information criterion (AIC) or Prediction Sum of Squares (PSS). The heuristic self-organization method is a type of the evolutional computation. In the GMDH-type neural network, the multi-co linearity occurs and the prediction values become unstable because the architecture of the neural network has many hidden layers whose characteristics are very complex. In the GMDH-type neural networks in this study, multi-co linearity does not occur and stable and accurate prediction values are obtained. This new algorithm is applied to the medical image recognitions of the liver and spleen. The optimum neural network architectures, which fit the complexity of the liver and spleen images, are automatically organized from the multi-detector row CT (MDCT) image of the abdominal regions and the liver and spleen regions are automatically recognized and extracted by the organized GMDH-type neural networks. The recognition results are compared with the conventional sigmoid function neural network trained using back propagation method and it is shown that this GMDH-type neural networks are useful for the medical image recognition problems of the abdominal multi-organs.","","","10.1109/CANDAR.2014.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7052176","Neural network;GMDH;Medical image recognition;Evolutional computation;Deep neural network","Biological neural networks;Neurons;Liver;Input variables;Computer architecture;Image recognition","backpropagation;computerised tomography;data handling;evolutionary computation;image recognition;liver;medical image processing;principal component analysis;regression analysis;self-organising feature maps","medical image recognition;abdominal multiorgans;hybrid multilayered GMDH-type neural network;principal component-regression analysis;group method of data handling;learning algorithm;deep neural network;heuristic self-organization method;prediction error criterion;Akaike information criterion;prediction sum of squares;evolutional computation;optimum neural network architectures;liver images;spleen images;multidetector row CT image;sigmoid function neural network;back propagation method","","5","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While unsupervised training can give gains for standard HMM training, it is more difficult to make use of unlabelled data for discriminative models. This paper explores semi-supervised training of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in a meeting recognition task. We first analyse the impact of imperfect transcription on the DNN and the ASR performance. As labelling error is the source of the problem, we investigate two options available to reduce that: selecting data with fewer errors, and changing the dependence on noise by reducing label precision. Both confidence based data selection and label resolution change are explored in the context of two scenarios of matched and unmatched unlabelled data. We introduce improved DNN based confidence score estimators and show their performance on data selection for both scenarios. Confidence score based data selection was found to yield up to 14.6% relative WER reduction, while better balance between label resolution and recognition hypothesis accuracy allowed further WER reductions by 16.6% relative in the mismatched scenario.","","","10.1109/SLT.2014.7078564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7078564","semi-supervised acoustic model training;confidence selection;deep neural networks","Abstracts;Reliability;Lead;Training;Accuracy;Silicon","Gaussian processes;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);mixture models;neural nets;speech recognition","semisupervised DNN training;training acoustic models;ASR;unsupervised training;standard HMM training;deep neural networks;meeting recognition task;data selection;unmatched unlabelled data;confidence score estimators;WER reduction","","6","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One common approach to adapting deep neural network (DNN) acoustic models is to perform global constrained maximum likelihood linear regression (CMLLR) at some point of the systems. Using CMLLR (or more generally, generative approaches) is advantageous especially in unsupervised adaptation scenarios with high baseline error rates. On the other hand, as the DNNs are less sensitive to the increase in the input dimensionality than GMMs, it is becoming more popular to use rich speech representations, such as log mel-filter bank channel outputs, instead of conventional low-dimensional feature vectors, such as MFCCs and PLP coefficients. This work discusses and compares three different configurations of DNN acoustic models that allow CMLLR-based speaker adaptive training (SAT) to be performed in systems with filter bank inputs. Results of unsupervised adaptation experiments conducted on three different data sets are presented, demonstrating that, by choosing an appropriate configuration, SAT with CMLLR can improve the performance of a well-trained filter bank-based speaker independent DNN system by 10.6% relative in a challenging task with a baseline error rate above 40%. It is also shown that the filter bank features are advantageous than the conventional features even when they are used with SAT models. Some other insights are also presented, including the effects of block diagonal transforms and system combination.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854825","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854825","Deep neural network;acoustic model adaptation;hybrid;tandem;stacked hybrid","Hidden Markov models;Acoustics;Adaptation models;Speech;Transforms;Speech processing;Speech recognition","acoustic signal processing;channel bank filters;maximum likelihood estimation;neural nets;regression analysis;speaker recognition;unsupervised learning","unsupervised adaptation;DNN acoustic models;filter bank input;speaker variations;speech recognition systems;deep neural network acoustic models;global constrained maximum likelihood linear regression;baseline error rates;input dimensionality;speech representations;log mel-filter bank channel outputs;low-dimensional feature vectors;PLP coefficients;CMLLR-based speaker adaptive training;CMLLR-based SAT;unsupervised adaptation experiments;filter bank-based speaker independent DNN system;filter bank features;block diagonal transforms","","19","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Learning is the integration of new knowledge/behaviors into a framework, and subsequently recalling what is relevant in the appropriate situation. To understand learning, we must consider how new information is received and the stages through which new information is processed as it progresses from immediate sensory experience to long-term storage. It is also important to understand how novices and experts organize, analyze or encode, and then retrieve necessary information. In this particular case, engineering students are the novices and engineering educators are the experts. Teaching consists of organizing, planning, delivering and evaluating the content of the subject area.

Training and generalization is an ill-defined problem in that many different networks may achieve the training goal; however each will respond differently to an unknown input. Traditional approaches include stopping the training early and/or restricting the size of the network These approaches ameliorate the problem of over-fitting where the network learns the patterns presented but is unable to generalize. Bayesian regularization addresses these issues by requiring the weights of the network to attain a minimum magnitude. This ensures that non-contributing weights are reduced significantly and the resulting network represents the essence of the inter-relations of the training. Bayesian Regularization simply introduces an additional term to the objective function. This term comprises the sum of the squares of the weights. The optimization process therefore not only achieves the objective of the original cost (i.e. the minimization of an error metric) but it also ensures that this objective is achieved with minimum-magnitude weights. We have introduced Bayesian Regularization in the training of Restricted Boltzmann Machines and have applied this method in experiments of hand-written numbers classification. Our experiments showed that by adding Bayesian regularization in the training of RBMs, we were able to improve the generalization capabilities of the trained network by reducing its recognition errors by more than 1.6%.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889458","Restricted Boltzmann Machine;over fitting;regularization;classification","Training;Neurons;Bayes methods;Approximation methods;Educational institutions;Testing;Feature extraction","belief networks;Boltzmann machines;generalisation (artificial intelligence);learning (artificial intelligence)","improved RBM;Bayesian regularization;restricted Boltzmann machine;deep learning networks;noncontributing weights;optimization process;minimum-magnitude weights;hand-written number classification","","7","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine-learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method. This algorithm identifies regions in the uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of producing model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM in essence uses a hill climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and alleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated through a case study of scenario discovery for the transition of the European energy system towards more sustainable functioning, focusing on identifying scenarios where the transition fails.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921259","","Input variables;Uncertainty;Bagging;Optimization;Vegetation;Classification algorithms;Decision trees","feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);optimisation;random processes;uncertainty handling","scenario discovery;random boxes;participatory model-based approach;scenario development;deep uncertainty;statistical machine-learning algorithms;patient rule induction method;uncertain model;PRIM;hill climbing optimization procedure;hill climbing optimization algorithms;local optima;plateaus;ridges;alleys;heterogeneously typed data;drawing inspiration;random forests;randomly selected features;bagging technique;European energy system;sustainable functioning","","","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With Secure Socket Layer (SSL) traffic on the rise due to applications securing or concealing their traffic via encryption, the ability to determine what applications are running within a network is getting more and more difficult. Traditional methods of traffic classification through port numbers and deep packet inspection tools have been deemed inadequate despite their continued popular usage.

They can be thought of as the building blocks of computer programs. In the learning of programming, it is necessary for students to build knowledge of a variety of plans that they can then make use of during the development of larger programs. This paper discusses two methods by which students can learn such plans, the ""conventional"" method that has been used by instructors for many years, and the ""completion"" method. The completion method requires students to complete part-complete solutions to given programming problems. As part of a research project, some students were observed using the completion method in conjunction with a software tool, CORT (code restructuring tool). The paper reports on one particular observation in which a student was required to build a programming plan.

The output of a quantifier is a real value, since training instances are the same as a classification problem, a natural approach is to train a classifier and to derive a quantifier from it. Some previous works have shown that just classifying the instances and counting the examples belonging to the class of interest classify count typically yields bad quantifiers, especially when the class distribution may vary between training and test. Hence, adjusted versions of classify count have been developed by using modified thresholds. However, previous works have explicitly discarded (without a deep analysis) any possible approach based on the probability estimations of the classifier. In this paper, we present a method based on averaging the probability estimations of a classifier with a very simple scaling that does perform reasonably well, showing that probability estimators for quantification capture a richer view of the problem than methods based on a threshold.","","","10.1109/ICDM.2010.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694031","quantification;probability estimators;class imbalance;classification","Training;Estimation;Probability;Machine learning;Accuracy;Data mining;Robustness","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;probability","machine learning;quantifier;probability estimations;classifier training","","21","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the depth and abstraction often associated with expressions of sentiment, we apply strictly lexical analysis to the opinions expressed about books and find that machine learning techniques are capable of resolving even fine-grained distinctions between opinions. Using an averaged perceptron classifier trained using a word subsequence kernel, we achieve an accuracy of 89% when distinguishing between 1- and 5-star reviews. Further, this same model yields significant separation when scoring intermediate reviews - making distinctions even human annotators find difficult.

In addition, emerging challenges such as overlapping classes, make class imbalance even harder to solve. Class overlap is caused due to ambiguous regions in the data where the prior probability of two or more classes are approximately equal. We are motivated to address the challenge of class overlap in the presence of imbalanced classes by a problem in pervasive computing. Specifically, we are designing smart environments that perform health monitoring and assistance. Our solution, ClusBUS, is a clustering-based under sampling technique that identifies data regions where minority class samples are embedded deep inside majority class. By removing majority class samples from these regions, ClusBUS preprocesses the data in order to give more importance to the minority class during classification. Experiments show that ClusBUS achieves improved performance over an existing method for handling class imbalance.","","","10.1109/ICDMW.2013.18","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6753930","Class imbalance;overlapping classes;sampling;automated prompting","Smart homes;Clustering algorithms;Accuracy;Noise;Monitoring;Machine learning algorithms;Support vector machines","home automation;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;pattern clustering;ubiquitous computing","class overlap;class imbalance;prompt situation detection;smart homes;machine learning;classification challenge;pervasive computing;smart environments;health monitoring;ClusBUS;clustering-based undersampling technique","","5","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A decision learning tree is constructed from the evolutionary relationships (or bipartitions) found in the evolutionary trees returned from a phylogenetic analysis. We treat evolutionary trees returned from multiple runs of a phylogenetic analysis as different classes. Then, we use the depth of a decision tree as a technique to measure how distinct the runs are from each other. Decision trees with shallow depth reflect non-convergence since the evolutionary trees can be classified with little information. Deep decision tree depths reflect convergence. We study Bayesian and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses consisting of thousands of trees. For some datasets studied here, a single distinguishing bipartition can classify the entire tree collection suggesting non-convergence of the underlying phylogenetic analysis. Thus, we believe that decision trees lead to new insights with the potential for helping biologists reconstruct more robust evolutionary trees.","","","10.1109/CIBCB.2010.5510326","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5510326","","Decision trees;Convergence;Phylogeny;Bayesian methods;Classification tree analysis;Machine learning;Sampling methods;Computational intelligence;Heuristic algorithms;Inference algorithms","bioinformatics;convergence;decision trees;evolution (biological);genetics;learning (artificial intelligence)","decision trees;phylogenetic analysis;convergence property;decision learning tree;evolutionary relationships;bipartitions;Bayesian phylogenetic analyses;maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses","","1","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lab., Stennis Space Center, MS, USA; NA; NA","OCEANS '02 MTS/IEEE","","2002","1","","331","337 vol.1","Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs) are used extensively for salvage operations, ocean floor surveying and numerous inspection activities that support a wide range of underwater commercial activities. In deep water (greater than 1000 ft) an ROV is the platform of choice because of the depth and endurance limitations for human divers. The key disadvantage to an ROV is the requirement for the long tether. The tether greatly inhibits the speed of the ROV, requires a ship with deck gear capable of handling this cable, and significantly restricts ship movement while deployed. Un-tethered Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) have entered the commercial market and have demonstrated the ability to perform deep-water surveys faster and cheaper than towed vessels. With further technological advances, UUVs have the potential for supplementing and even replacing ROVs for many deep-water operations because of the cost and problems associated with the tether. One promising scenario for the near future is to use an ROV or surface ship to control multiple UUVs in a local work area. Typically in this scenario the UUVs are used to extend the sensor footprint of the ROV or surface ship. Another area of interest is the UUV team concept. A stereotypical UUV team would be a heterogeneous mix of several low-cost specific purpose vehicles, guided and supported by one or two higher cost control vessels. Because of the severe restrictions that the sub-sea environment places on communication and positioning, precision underwater navigation is difficult. Currently most precision underwater navigation relies on some sort of infrastructure such as surface ships or underwater beacons placed in known positions. Using these assets as reference-points sub-sea navigation is carried out. Some situations require that the environmental and/or commercial attributes of an area be assessed before an infrastructure exists. In order to do this the UUV team must be able to navigate to an area, carry out its task and return without any pre-existing infrastructure or step by step guidance. Given basic assumptions about the type and frequency of sensor input we present a biologically inspired, decentralized methodology for safely and efficiently moving a loose formation of UUV's to and from the task area with the goal of minimizing outside guidance.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.2002.1193293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1193293","","Biological control systems;Remotely operated vehicles;Marine vehicles;Navigation;Sea surface;Underwater vehicles;Costs;Oceans;Inspection;Humans","remotely operated vehicles;underwater vehicles;learning (artificial intelligence);genetic algorithms;feedforward neural nets;neurocontrollers","salvage operations;ocean floor surveying;ROVs;inspection;Un-tethered Unmanned Underwater Vehicles;UUVs;deep-water surveys;UUV team;machine learning;genetic algorithm;neural network","","14","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Performance Evaluation in Grid Computing: A Modeling and Prediction Perspective","H. Li","LIACS, Netherlands","Seventh IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid (CCGrid '07)","","2007","","","869","874","Experimental performance studies on computer systems, including Grids, require deep understandings on their workload characteristics. The need arises from two important and closely related topics in performance evaluation, namely, workload modeling and performance prediction. Both topics rely heavily on the representative workload data and have their arsenal from statistics and machine learning. Nevertheless, their goals and the nature of research differ considerably. Workload modeling aims at building mathematical models to generate workloads that can be used in simulation-based performance evaluation studies. It should statistically resemble the original real-world data therefore marginal statistics and second-order properties such as autocorrelation and power spectrum are important matching criteria. Performance prediction, on the other hand, intends to provide realtime forecast of important performance metrics (such as application run time and queue wait time) which can support Grid scheduling decisions. From this perspective prediction accuracy as well as performance should be considered to evaluate candidate techniques. My PhD research focuses primarily on these two topics in space-shared, data-intensive Grid environments. Starting from a comprehensive workload analysis with emphasis on the correlation structures and the scaling behavior, several basic job arrival patterns such as pseudo-periodicity and long range dependence are identified. Models are further proposed to capture these important arrival patterns and a complete workload model including run time is being investigated. The strong autocorrelations present in run time and queue wait time series inspire the research for performance prediction based on learning from historical data. Techniques based on a instance based learning algorithm and several improvements are proposed and empirically evaluated. Research plans are proposed to use the results of workload modeling and performance prediction in the evaluation of scheduling strategies in data-intensive Grid environments.","","","10.1109/CCGRID.2007.84","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4215465","","Grid computing;Predictive models;Autocorrelation;Statistics;Mathematical model;Measurement;Physics computing;Computer science;Electronic mail;Home computing","grid computing;learning (artificial intelligence);performance evaluation","performance evaluation;grid computing;workload modeling;machine learning;autocorrelation;power spectrum;Grid scheduling decisions;instance based learning algorithm","","10","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the number of customers has continued to increase, the need to improve efficiency and minimize costs has grown. This growth has been the impetus for a DSN transformation from an equipment-for-rent provider to a provider of standard services. Service orientation naturally leads to requirements for service management, including proactive measurement of service quality and service levels as well as the efficiency of internal processes and the performance of service provisioning systems. DSN System Engineering has surveyed industry offerings to determine if commercial successes in decision support and Business Intelligence (BI) solutions can be applied to the DSN. A pilot project was initiated, and subsequently executed to determine the feasibility of repurposing a commercial Business Intelligence platform for engineering analysis in conjunction with the platform's intended business reporting and analysis functions. This paper surveys the challenges, the lessons learned, and highlights the interesting results to date.

The beacon monitor operations technology is aimed at decreasing the total volume of downlinked engineering telemetry by reducing the frequency of downlink and the volume of data received per pass. Cost savings are achieved by reducing the amount of routine telemetry processing and analysis performed by ground staff. With beacon monitoring, the spacecraft will assess its own health and will transmit one of four subcarrier frequency tones to inform the ground how urgent it is to track the spacecraft for telemetry. If all conditions are nominal, the tone provides periodic assurance to ground personnel that the mission is proceeding as planned without having to receive and analyze downlinked telemetry. If there is a problem, the tone will indicate that tracking is required and the resulting telemetry will contain a concise summary of what has occurred since the last telemetry pass. The beacon technology has been proven successful on DS1 through a series of tone tests and data summarization experiments. This collection of experiments was called the DS1 Beacon Monitor Experiment or BMOX.

To do so, the issue of imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter is considered when frequency-division duplexing is used, for which the feedback channel is limited. We first introduce a regret based learning approach to optimize the transmit beamforming parameters for the cases when the feedback channel is temporarily unavailable during deep fades. We then propose a coalition formation game model to cluster the small cell base stations so that they can perform cluster-wise joint beamforming. We take the \tit{recursive core} as the solution concept of the coalition formation game. To obtain the recursive core, we first consider a typical merge-split algorithm.

Alternatively, we adopt the merge-only algorithm which guarantees the formation stability and show that its outcome belongs to the recursive core.

Developing a cyber-security ontology is no exception. A security ontology can improve search for security learning resources that are scattered in different locations in different formats, since it can provide a common controlled vocabulary to annotate the resources with consistent semantics. In this paper, we present a bootstrapping method for developing a cyber-security ontology using both a security textbook index that provides a list of terms in the security domain and an existing security ontology as a scaffold. The bootstrapping approach automatically extracts the textbook index terms (concepts), derives a relationship to a concept in the security ontology for each and classifies them into the existing security ontology. The bootstrapping approach relies on the exact and approximate similarity matching of concepts as well as the category information obtained from external sources such as Wikipedia. The results show feasibility of our method to develop a more comprehensive and scalable cyber-security ontology with rich concepts from a textbook index. We provide criteria used to select a scaffold ontology among existing ontologies. The current approach can be improved by considering synonyms, deep searching in Wikipedia categories, and domain expert validation.","","","10.1109/ARES.2013.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6657291","security ontology;cyber-security;learning objects;textbook;index terms","Ontologies;Indexes;Computer security;Buildings;Semantics;Materials","learning (artificial intelligence);ontologies (artificial intelligence);pattern matching;security of data;vocabulary","bootstrapping approach;cyber-security ontology;textbook index terms;domain ontology;knowledge engineering;security learning resources;common controlled vocabulary;concept exact similarity matching;concept approximate similarity matching;category information;scaffold ontology;synonyms;Wikipedia categories;domain expert validation","","6","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Their use in primary schools allows pupils to have concrete yet full programming experiences at the age in which Piaget situates the concrete operational stage of cognitive development. Indeed, for their first robotic activities, pupils think of paths where the robot moves forward, decides which direction to go when getting to a crossroad or repeats part of its previous trip. In planning a path for their robot, children walk it themselves thus finding out its successive tangible parts and related features. Our pupils use NQCBaby and NXCJunior programming languages for the formal specification of their robot's behaviour. These are textual languages, mother-tongue-based and Logo-like, in order to be oriented to children rather than to robots. Thus, when programming small robots, children are introduced to a deep computer competence because they deal with the basic blocks of algorithmics (sequence, selection and iteration) and learn how to specify them.","","","10.1109/ICALT.2008.190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4561692","Primary Schools;Mindstorms;programmable robots","Concrete;Robot programming;Cognitive robotics;Educational institutions;Legged locomotion;Robot sensing systems;Path planning;Computational geometry;Virtual colonoscopy;Computer languages","computer science education;control engineering education;mobile robots;robot programming","concrete programming;small robots;primary schools;robotic activities;path planning;robots programming;computer competence","","4","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we develop a novel 3D CNN model for action recognition. This model extracts features from both the spatial and the temporal dimensions by performing 3D convolutions, thereby capturing the motion information encoded in multiple adjacent frames. The developed model generates multiple channels of information from the input frames, and the final feature representation combines information from all channels. To further boost the performance, we propose regularizing the outputs with high-level features and combining the predictions of a variety of different models.

In order to extract the representation of facial expressions, we choose the optical flow method because it could analyze video image sequences effectively and reduce the influence of personal appearance difference on facial expression recognition. Then, we train the stacked SAE with the optical flow field as the input to extract high-level features. To achieve classification, we apply a softmax classifier on the top layer of the stacked SAE. This method is applied to the Extended Cohn-Kanade Dataset (CK+). The expression classification result shows that the SAE performances the classification effectively and successfully.

We show that a standard multilayer perceptron with proper regularization performs well on this task. Experimental results indicate that the resulting separation system performs significantly better in a variety of unknown noises in low SNR conditions.

The RA's architecture embodies system-level autonomy in three major components: planning and scheduling, execution, and fault diagnosis and reconfiguration. Lessons learned include: the architecture was confirmed; active participation by nonautonomy personnel in the development is essential; communication of new concepts is essential, difficult, and hampered by differences in terminology; giving a spacecraft system-level autonomy changes organizational roles in operating the spacecraft after launch, and hence changes roles during development; software models supporting functions traditionally handled on the ground must be developed early enough to get on-board; shortfalls in planned features must be technically and developmentally accomodatable, in particular not to threaten the launch schedule; traditional commanding must be supported; testing must be emphasized.

Meanwhile, due to the advantages including programmability and power-efficiency, FPGAs have been applied to custom computing in many domains. Previous work has made resources of FPGA available under the cloud environment. However, the effective usage of FPGAs in the cloud requires efficient online task scheduling: to properly assign as many tasks from different tenants as possible to the FPGAs. In this paper, we propose a benefit-based scheduling metric to evaluate the task assignment Based on the metric, we accelerate task execution according to our benefit-based scheduling algorithms. By applying our benefit-based scheduling metric to a real OpenStack-based cloud environment, 60.32% computing resources are saved compared with the conventional throughput-based metric. Furthermore, a Replacement-Considering algorithm, which considers the task replacement, is proposed taking the characteristics of cloud into account. The results show that our FPGA accelerated cloud system is 1.386 times faster than using the previous algorithm.","","","10.1109/FPT.2014.7082811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7082811","Cloud Computing;FPGAs;Scheduling;Benefit-based Metric","Field programmable gate arrays;Measurement;Acceleration;Cloud computing;Scheduling algorithms;Scheduling","cloud computing;field programmable gate arrays;scheduling;software metrics","online scheduling;FPGA computation;cloud computing;custom computing;benefit-based scheduling metric;task assignment evaluation;task execution;OpenStack-based cloud environment;replacement-considering algorithm;task replacement","","2","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Training styles such as study with manuals and exercise with a numerical simulator have been developed. However, besides such training styles, a learning environment should provide the functions that enable operators to achieve deep understanding of target plants. The qualitative simulation-based learning environment aims at providing operators a thinking tool for understanding, where human-computer interaction is also designed based on this notion. To realize this environment in a computer, two problems on qualitative reasoning have to be resolved. One is how to construct qualitative models of adequate grain size as target plants become complex, and the other is how to prune spurious qualitative behaviors. New techniques on qualitative reasoning are proposed, which are called qualitative reasoning with association mechanisms to qualitative information. Its effectiveness is discussed through applying this framework to large-scale power plants.<>","","","10.1109/PCCC.1993.344526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=344526","","Computational modeling;Large-scale systems;Computer simulation;Numerical simulation;Grain size;Power generation;Quality management;Analytical models;Information analysis;Manuals","computer aided instruction;digital simulation;common-sense reasoning","qualitative simulation-based learning environment;causal understanding;complex phenomena;large-scale plants;manuals;numerical simulator;human-computer interaction;qualitative reasoning;grain size;spurious qualitative behaviors","","1","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net.

The paper's focus of analysis is on application platforms that result from the generative system that is the mobile Internet combined with mobile devices, further enhanced by advanced user interaction modalities. Conceptual parallels are drawn between the concerns of “cyberlaw” scholars and those of companies that make up the mobile telecoms industry in order to provide a theoretical basis for this paper. ""Cyberlaw"" scholarship concerns the need to legally control, or regulate, the Internet against abuse, whilst maintaining its innovative essence. The mobile telecoms industry seeks to control the mobile Internet for profit, whilst maintaining its capacity for innovative and appealing content and services. As part of this research, current and emergent revenue models are identified for the components that make up the mobile industry. Methods of analysing these business models are proposed using value networks and control points, which are functional areas in a value chain or network where power can be exercised, as the unit of analysis. This method of analysis is illustrated with an initial example and an agenda for further research is outlined.

However, it is a difficult problem to directly model the spatiotemporal variations of trajectories due to their high dimensionality and nonlinearity. In this paper, a novel tracking and trajectory recognition algorithm is proposed by combining a bi-directional deep neural network called ""Continuous Autoencoder"" into a probabilistic framework. First, the ""Continuous Autoencoder"" network embeds high-dimensional trajectories in a two-dimensional plane based on a peculiar training rule and learns a trajectory generative model by its inverse mapping. Then a set of plausible trajectories are generated by the trajectory generative model. In the tracking process, the target state at each time step is estimated by combining above plausible trajectory set with particle filter. The trajectory identity is inferred by evaluating the improved Hausdorff distance between the estimated trajectory up to now and the truncated reference trajectories. Furthermore, the trajectory recognition results can provide valuable information for the next tracking. The experiments on tracking and recognizing handwritten digits show that the proposed algorithm can not only robustly track and exactly recognize in background clutter and occlusion, but also realize the track before identification.","","","10.1109/CISE.2009.5366549","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5366549","","Trajectory;Handwriting recognition;Surveillance;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Bidirectional control;Neural networks;Inverse problems;Target tracking;Particle tracking;State estimation","computer vision;image motion analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;particle filtering (numerical methods);target tracking","tracking algorithm;recognition algorithm;continuous autoencoder network;motion trajectory;behavior recognition;visual surveillance;guidance;spatiotemporal variation;bidirectional deep neural network;learning;trajectory generative model;inverse mapping;target state estimation;plausible trajectory;particle filter;trajectory identity;Hausdorff distance;background clutter;occlusion;visual tracking;computer vision","","","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Statistical methods are preferred to port-based ones since they don't rely on the port number, which can change dynamically, and to deep packet inspection since they also work for encrypted traffic. These methods combine the statistical analysis of the application packet flow parameters, such as packet size and inter-packet time, with machine learning techniques. Other successful approaches rely on the way the hosts communicate and their traffic patterns to identify applications. In this paper, we propose a new online method for traffic classification that combines the statistical and host-based approaches in order to construct a robust and precise method for early Internet traffic identification. Without loss of generality we use the packet size as the main feature for the classification and we benefit from the traffic profile of the host (i.e., which application and how much) to refine the classification and decide in favor of this or that application. The host profile is then updated online based on the result of the classification of previous flows originated by or addressed to the same host. We evaluate our method on real traces using several applications. The results show that leveraging the traffic pattern of the host ameliorates the performance of statistical methods.

However, RBM is an unsupervised model which can not exploit the rich supervised information of data. Therefore, we consider combining the descriptive (generative) ability of RBM with the discriminative ability of supervised subspace models, i.e., Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FDA), marginal Fisher analysis (MFA), and heat kernel MFA (hkMFA). Specifically, the hidden layer of RBM is regularized by the supervised subspace criteria, and the joint learning model can then be efficiently optimized by gradient descent and graph construction (used to define the scatter matrix in the subspace models) on mini-batch data. Compared with the traditional subspace models (FDA, MFA, hkMFA), the proposed hybrid models are essentially nonlinear and can be optimized by gradient descent instead of eigenvalue decomposition. More importantly, traditional subspace models can only reduce the dimensionality (because of linear transformation), while the proposed models can also increase the dimensionality for better class discrimination. Experiments on three databases demonstrate that the proposed hybrid models outperform both RBM and their counterpart subspace models (FDA, MFA, hkMFA) consistently.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889447","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889447","","Feature extraction;Data models;Training;Joints;Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;Mathematical model;Analytical models","Boltzmann machines;eigenvalues and eigenfunctions;feature extraction;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence)","restricted Boltzmann machine;feature extraction;RBM;deep neural networks;rich supervised information;Fisher linear discriminant analysis;FDA;marginal Fisher analysis;heat kernel MFA;hkMFA;supervised subspace criteria;joint learning model;gradient descent;graph construction;mini-batch data;subspace models;eigenvalue decomposition;dimensionality reduction;databases","","4","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Partition testing divides the input space into disjoint equivalence classes and combinatorial testing selects a subset of all possible input class combinations, according to criteria such as pairwise coverage. The down side of this approach is that the partitioning of the input space into equivalence classes (input classification) is done manually. It is expensive and requires deep domain and implementation understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to classify test inputs and their dependencies automatically. Firstly, random (or automatically generated) input vectors are sent to the system under test (SUT). For each input vector, an observed “hit vector” is produced by monitoring the execution of the SUT. Secondly, hit vectors are grouped into clusters using machine learning. Each cluster contains similar hit vectors, i.e., similar behaviors, and from them we obtain corresponding clusters of input vectors. Input classes are then extracted for each input parameter straightforwardly. Our experiments with a number of subjects show good results as the automatically generated classifications are the same or very close to the expected ones.","","","10.1109/ASE.2013.6693123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6693123","Automated input classifications;combinatorial testing;invariant inference","Vectors;Testing;Concrete;Support vector machine classification;Systematics;Servers;Clustering algorithms","inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;program testing;reverse engineering","automated inference;combinatorial testing;partition testing;disjoint equivalence classes;input class combinations;pairwise coverage;input classification;deep domain understanding;implementation understanding;system under test;SUT;hit vector;machine learning;input parameter","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As relaxation convolution sharply increase the total number of parameters, we adopt alternate training in ATR-CNN to regularize the neural network during training procedure.

In particular, we use a recurrent version of the Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro (BCM) network with lateral inhibition to map histories of symbols into activations of the recurrent layer. Recurrent BCM networks perform a kind of time-conditional projection pursuit. We compare the finite-context models built on top of BCM recurrent activations with those constructed on top of RNN recurrent activation vectors. As a test bed we use two complex symbolic sequences with rather deep memory structures. It is shown that the BCM-based model has a comparable or better performance than its RNN-based counterpart.

The network is trained with raw RGB image patches cropped by a large window centered at each pixel of an image to extract feature representations. Then the depth map of a test image can be efficiently obtained by forward-passing the image through the trained model plus a simple up-sampling. Contrary to most previous methods based on graphical model and depth sampling, our method alleviates the needs for engineered features and for assumptions about semantic information of the scene. We achieve state-of-the-art results on Make 3D dataset, while keeping low computational time at the test time.","","","10.1109/VCIP.2014.7051531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051531","Depth inference;convolutional neural network;linear regressor;feature representation","Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Training;Semantics;Graphical models;Vectors","feature extraction;image representation;image sampling;image texture;inference mechanisms;neural nets;regression analysis","depth inference;image content;deep learning model;convolutional neural network;CNN;linear regressor;raw RGB image patches;feature representations;trained model;up-sampling;graphical model;depth sampling;Make 3D dataset","","1","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Iyer","Systems & Technology Group, IBM Corporation, Hopewell Junction, NY 12533, USA","2012 International Electron Devices Meeting","","2012","","","33.1.1","33.1.4","Embedded memory (eMemory) plays a key role in the performance of modern multi-core processors, and for a broad class of cache-balanced systems, can account for up to 70% of the die area. Memory is highly diagnosable and is an excellent process-learning vehicle besides pushing lithographic and process capability to the limit. Here we look at ways to increase embedded memory capacity and performance in two ways: integrating dense embedded DRAM using Deep Trench (DT) capacitors into high performance logic and using 3-dimensional integration (3Di) to integrate even larger amounts of cache close to the processing units. We also address how the DT capacitors can significantly improve overall chip performance by reducing mid-frequency power supply noise on these chips. We show that this holistic approach to embedded memory makes judicious use of SRAM, DRAM and extends to 3Di and provides the basis of “orthogonal” scaling beyond that provided by conventional lithographic scaling alone.","","","10.1109/IEDM.2012.6479155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6479155","","Random access memory;Capacitors;Silicon;Face;Complexity theory;Stacking;Through-silicon vias","cache storage;capacitors;DRAM chips;logic circuits;microprocessor chips;SRAM chips;three-dimensional integrated circuits","dense embedded memory evolution;high performance logic technologies;eMemory;modern multicore processors;cache-balanced systems;excellent process-learning vehicle;embedded memory capacity;dense embedded DRAM;deep trench capacitors;DT capacitors;three-dimensional integration;3Di;midfrequency power supply noise;SRAM;DRAM;orthogonal scaling;lithographic scaling","","21","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Object orientation has emerged as a dominant paradigm in designing and constructing such large and complex information systems, which is being taught to undergraduate students of Computer Science and Engineering. The use of java technology to develop applications is found preferred one [1]. There exists a knowledge gap between industry expectations and students knowledge. Hence deep learning of java programming is essential attribute to reduce the gap [1]. This paper presents classification of lab assignments as demonstration, Exercises, structured Enquiry type and open ended types with an approach of using conceptual model as intermediate step before writing java code for a given problem statement. This classification of assignments/problem statements move the responsibility from a professor to student where the latter involvement is observed high in achieving the objectives set for each type in classification of assignments, hence helps to meet industry expectations. The conceptual model, drawing a class diagram using standard notations (diagrammatic representations) improves the students understanding of object oriented concepts [7], for a given lab assignment which in-turn eases the student effort in translating the class diagram into program code by following the syntax. The students will be graded during assessment as Grade-S, Grade-A, Grade-B, Grade-C, Grade-D, Grade-E, Grade-F and where Grade-S is highest and Grade-F is lowest. The results of assessment are analyzed for year 2013 and 2014 batches and it is observed that, there is increase in grade A in year 2014 compared to year 2013. The observed change is due to the above said approach. The result analysis of year 2013 and 2012 shows that, the grade F is increased little in results of year 2013, it is due to the current approach where the lab assignments are classified and students are expected to apply the concepts studied effectively and few students unable to follow the approach.","","","10.1109/MITE.2014.7020272","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020272","paradigm;dominant;shrink;classification;conceptual model;class diagrams;assignment","Object oriented modeling;Java;Object oriented programming;Education;Unified modeling language;Programming profession","computer science education;educational courses;educational technology;engineering education;information systems;Java;object-oriented programming;problem solving","lab assignments;problem solving;object oriented programming lab course;information systems;undergraduate students;computer science education;engineering education;Java technology;deep learning","","1","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast, deep-submicron CMOS usually involves processes with high complexity and tight process tolerance. By necessity, this dictates frequent process monitoring with send ahead test wafers in order to assure accelerated yield learning during early phases of manufacturing. However these send ahead test wafers, although beneficial in the overall yield improvement, will increase the total raw (theoretical) process time and decrease the equipment availabilities for real processing in the line. In this paper, we examine the impact of send ahead rest wafers on process cycle time, wafer throughput, and fab line equipment capacity requirements. Discrete Event Simulation was used to run a hypothetical fab model with an industry standard CMOS base process. Examples will be given for fab sizes ranging from early manufacturing 50 wafer starts per day to high volume 600 wafer starts per day. We will demonstrate that with careful planning in equipment capacity ramping in early manufacturing phases, send ahead process monitoring can be practised without lengthening the cycle time, decreasing the line throughput, and placing any additional burdens in the total cost of capital investment in the fab line.<>","","","10.1109/IEMT.1994.404711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=404711","","Monitoring;Manufacturing processes;Semiconductor device manufacture;Costs;CMOS process;Testing;Throughput;Lead time reduction;Vehicles;CMOS technology","semiconductor device manufacture;stock control;MOSFET;production testing;circuit optimisation;integrated circuit yield;discrete event simulation","process monitoring;semiconductor manufacturing;short cycle time;product inventories;product costs;technology products;deep-submicron CMOS;process tolerance;test wafers;accelerated yield learning;equipment availabilities;process cycle time;wafer throughput;fab line equipment capacity requirements;discrete event simulation;fab sizes;equipment capacity ramping;capital investment;line throughput","","3","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, some small video production units are thinking a dynamic, reasonable price with good quality DSLRs -Nikon D90 and Canon 5D Mark II with built in video chip, in stead of current expensive video systems since the winter of 2008. The photography world is beginning to adapt to a new phase in the marriage of cameras and computing technology: the arrival of SLRs that can shoot not just still images, but video too. The change began with the arrival of image sensors, the light-sensitive microchips that replaced film. Now, two new DSLRs are taking another step away from the film paradigm, following in the footsteps of point-and-shoot cameras by recording continuous video and not just still images. Doubtless video will gradually spread to other DSLR models and makers, which would create more impacts not only the consumer and professional market of photography but video market.

We combined expert judgement with a regression model and a geographic information system. Using a grid mesh of 600times600m size as a spatial reference framework based on the land use map, the concept of hemeroby was used for assessment ecological sustainability of agricultural landscape. Fourteen variables describing the landscape structure were chosen as predictors for ecological sustainability of landscape. The results suggested that the following land use scenario was recommended: all land with deep soil and slopes smaller than 15deg should be used for agriculture cropland, all farmland with slopes between 15deg-20deg should be converted to orchard or cash trees, and all farmland with slopes between 20deg-25deg should be converted to grassland. A great reduction of on-farm income, however, would be induced on the short term by such a scenario.

Here, we address this problem by making the following contributions. First, in answer to one of the key problems of age estimation research-absence of data-we offer a unique data set of face images, labeled for age and gender, acquired by smart-phones and other mobile devices, and uploaded without manual filtering to online image repositories. We show the images in our collection to be more challenging than those offered by other face-photo benchmarks. Second, we describe the dropout-support vector machine approach used by our system for face attribute estimation, in order to avoid over-fitting. This method, inspired by the dropout learning techniques now popular with deep belief networks, is applied here for training support vector machines, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time. Finally, we present a robust face alignment technique, which explicitly considers the uncertainties of facial feature detectors.

These tests were performed to assess the readiness of the ground system and spacecraft to support Ka-band demonstration activities during MRO's primary science phase (PSP). As a result of these tests a number of important lessons were learned regarding the performance of the Ka-band link and the performance of the ground equipment. This paper presents the performance of the ground antenna pointing, delta differential one-way ranging (DeltaDOR) performance and the telemetry performance of the Ka-band link.

"Towards real-time music auto-tagging using sparse features","Y.

Nevertheless, such algorithms are usually computationally expensive. This paper investigates techniques to accelerate sparse feature extraction and music classification. To study the trade-off between computational efficiency and accuracy, we compare state-of-the-art, dense audio features with sparse features computed using 1) sparse coding with a random dictionary, 2) randomized clustering forest, and 3) an extension of randomized clustering forest to temporal signals. For classifier training and prediction, we compare support vector machines with linear or non-linear kernel functions. We conduct evaluation on music auto-tagging for 140 genre/style tags using a subset of 7,799 songs of the CAL10k data set. Our result leads to an 11-fold speed increase with 3.45% accuracy loss comparing to dense features.

More recently, the advantages of using case studies have been realised by university-level computing educators, too. New approaches have been introduced in computing education - such as project-based learning, problem-based learning, situated learning or inquiry-based learning. Many of those approaches successfully use case studies. Despite the increasing popularity of this teaching methodology there seems to be a deep lack in any research papers or practice reports which would attempt to describe, evaluate and assess possible approaches or models in using case studies in computing education. This conference contribution reports on selected best practices of course design and delivery implemented in one of the core courses of the Bachelor of Science (Information Systems Management) degree program (BSc (ISM)) offered by the School of Information Systems (SIS) at the Singapore Management University (SMU). The paper presents, evaluates, compares and assesses four different course design and delivery models which are largely based on case studies and are extensively using this teaching methodology throughout the entire course lifecycle (starting with the course design process, delivery of face-to-face teaching sessions, student assessment process and post-mortem course review process).","","","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044194","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044194","case studies in computing education;course design and delivery;best practices;case-study based course design and delivery;case-study based delivery models","Decision support systems;Handheld computers;Computational modeling;Companies;Education;Electronic mail;Technological innovation","computer science education;educational courses;educational institutions;information systems;teaching","computing education;case study-based course design;delivery models;university-level education;project-based learning;problem-based learning;situated learning;inquiry-based learning;teaching methodology;bachelor of science degree program;information systems management degree program;BSc;ISM;school of information systems;SIS;Singapore Management University;SMU","","2","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The local reduction can present more optimal description for single decision class than the existing relative reductions. It is proven that the core of reduction or relative reduction can be expressed as the union of the cores of local reductions. The discernibility matrix of reduction and relative reduction can be obtained by composing discernibility matrices of local reduction.

We propose to do phonetic mapping between Hindi and English in the first stage, training Hindi acoustic models by sharing data between Hindi-English phone pairs in the second stage, and finally fine-tuning the acoustic model by using the Hindi data. We evaluate and compare these approaches with experiments using 1 hour of transcribed Hindi data and 15 hours of Wall Street Journal English data.

Teaching and Learning in an Era of Change","","1997","2","","778","780 vol.2","The paper focusses on the development of a hands-on project-based evaluation procedure for a senior level university course in robotics. In essence, the evaluation procedure involved dividing the class into small teams. Then a universal task was given to all the teams, which required the design and construction of a robot to complete. The object of the task was to develop an autonomous machine that could find and retrieve a specific ball (1"" dia.) from the bottom of a water filled container. Three balls (one aluminum, one steel and one plexiglas) were initially randomly placed into a 16"" deep plastic container (trash can). Then a die was thrown to randomly select which ball was to be retrieved. Once the robot had been set for retrieval of the selected ball, it was placed on top of the container and switched on. No further human intervention was then permitted. A set of rules were issued to explicitly define the task and permit judgments of success or failure to be made. Having successfully applied this concept to the Fall 1995 Robotic Systems class at USF, a number of common solutions were observed amongst the eight robots created. Ball retrieval tended to be achieved using either a suction pump, a bottom searching scoop, or a paddle/elevator arrangement. Having retrieved all three balls, a sorting system was employed, usually involving a cantilever scheme that separated the balls by weight. A second more ingenious technique was to separate the balls based on how far they bounced when dropped.","","","10.1109/FIE.1997.635948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=635948","","Educational robots;Orbital robotics;Mechanical engineering;Containers;Costs;Aluminum;Steel;Plastic products;Humans;Sorting","control engineering education;robots;student experiments;project engineering;educational courses","innovative student solutions;robotics design exercise;hands-on project-based evaluation procedure;senior level university course;robot design;robot construction;ball retrieval;water filled container;aluminum ball;steel ball;plexiglas ball;suction pump;bottom searching scoop;paddle/elevator arrangement;ball sorting system;cantilever scheme","","","4","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Adaptation and personalization in AEH are produced from interaction of learner, pedagogic, domain, adaptation, and presentation models. This paper discusses Knowledge Map, a prototype tool for managing and visualizing domain model of AEH and it integrates cognitively-oriented and pedagogically-oriented methods. Domain model organizes knowledge space, which contains a network of concepts or topics, and hyperspace, in which adaptation and personalization are offered to students. There are two methods implemented. The first method is cognitively-oriented, by which concepts learned in a course are organized in a network of concepts. With this first method, student can get a visualization of the network and explore nodes. The main drawback of this method is that students may get lost after doing deep exploration. The second is mixed pedagogically-oriented and cognitively-oriented method that organizes a course in a hierarchic structure of topics and sub-topics and a graph of concepts for each sub-topic. A Greedy algorithm has been implemented to guide students to certain topics. To test the methods' performances, a quantitative experiment has been conducted with three tested parameters: impression, learnability, and helpfulness. The experiments results show that the mixed method visualization is more impressive as this is more helpful for students to understand learning materials than the other method. Furthermore, the mixed method is more learnable, as students find it easier to gain a whole view of learning materials organized by this method rather than those organized by the cognitively-oriented method.","","","10.1109/ICODSE.2014.7062699","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7062699","Adaptive Educational Hypermedia;Cognitively-oriented;Mixed pedagogically- and cognitively-oriented method;quantitative experiment;impression;learnability;helpfulness","Materials;Adaptation models;Education;Visualization;Adaptive systems;Prototypes","computer aided instruction;data visualisation;educational courses;graph theory;greedy algorithms;hypermedia","cognitively-oriented method;pedagogically-oriented method;adaptive educational hypermedia;AEH;learning tool;learning content;learner model;pedagogic model;adaptation model;presentation model;knowledge map;domain model management;domain model visualization;knowledge space;course;subtopic hierarchic structure;concept graph;greedy algorithm;impression;learnability;helpfulness;mixed method visualization;learning materials","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

FabLabs are community and educational resources and open to the public. Development of STEM based workforce skills such as digital fabrication and advanced manufacturing can be enhanced using this platform. Particularly notable is the potential of the FabLab platform in STEM education. The active learning environment engages and supports a diversity of learners, while the iterative learning that is supported by the FabLab rapid prototyping platform facilitates depth of understanding, creativity, innovation and mastery. The product and project based learning that occurs in FabLabs develops in the student a personal sense of accomplishment, self-awareness, command of the material and technology. This helps build the interest and confidence necessary to excel in STEM and throughout life. Finally the introduction and use of relevant technologies at every stage of the education process ensures technical familiarity and a broad knowledge base needed for work in STEM based fields.

They are also often unaccustomed to instructional materials consisting of a combination of text, diagrams, and equations. This raises the question of whether instruction on elementary electrical circuit analysis for novice learners should employ contextualized representations of the circuits with familiar components, such as batteries, or employ abstract representations with the abstract engineering terms and symbols. A further question is if text labels in the circuit diagrams would aid these learners. This study examined these research questions with a “2 × 3” experimental design, in which the two forms of representation (abstract or contextualized) were considered under three types of diagram labeling (no labels, static labels, or interactive labels). The design was implemented in an instructional module on elementary circuit analysis for novice learners. Results indicated that abstract representations led to higher near- and far-transfer post-test scores, and that interactive (student-generated) labeling resulted in higher near-transfer scores than either the no-labels or static-labels conditions. These findings suggest that abstract representations promote the development of deep, transferrable knowledge and that generative methods of integration, such as interactive diagram labeling, can facilitate learning with multiple external representations.","","","10.1109/TE.2013.2284258","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637101","Circuit analysis instruction;circuit diagram;diagram label;electrical circuit analysis;multiple external representations;novice learner","Abstracts;Circuit analysis;Labeling;Resistance;Batteries;Resistors;Materials","circuit diagrams;electronic engineering education;network analysis","circuit analysis learning;contextualized circuit representations;abstract circuit representations;diagram label effect;abstract engineering symbols;instructional materials;elementary electrical circuit analysis;novice learners;abstract engineering terms;circuit diagrams;far-transfer post-test scores;near-transfer post-test scores;static-label conditions;no-label conditions;interactive diagram labeling","","15","76","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

FPGAs provide a hardware accelerator framework to speed up many algorithms, including the learning and recognition tasks of ever growing neural network topologies and problem complexities. Current FPGAs include DSP blocks - hard blocks that allow designers to roll in hardware otherwise built using significant quantity of reconfigurable logic (slices) and increase clock performance of arithmetic operations. Accelerators on FPGAs can take advantage of, in some products, thousands DSP blocks on a single chip to scale up the parallelism of designs. Conversely, IEEE floating point representation cannot be fully implemented in single DSP slices and requires a significant amount of general logic thus reducing the amount of resources available to breadth of parallelism in an accelerator design. Reduced precision fixed point format arithmetic can fit within a single DSP slice without external logic. It has been used successfully for training MLP-BP neural networks on small problems. The merit of reduced precision computation in RBM networks for sizable problems has not been evaluated. In this work, a three layer RBM network linked to one classification layer (1.6M weights) is used to learn the classic MNIST dataset over a set of common limited precisions used in FPGA designs. Issues of parameter saturation and a method to overcome inherent training difficulties is discussed. The results demonstrate that RBM can be trained successfully using resource-efficient fixed point formats commonly found in current FPGA devices.","","","10.1109/ReConFig.2011.79","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6128551","FPGA;DSP block;Neural network;RBM;Arithmetic representation","Neurons;Field programmable gate arrays;Training;Hardware;Digital signal processing;Convergence;Clocks","backpropagation;belief networks;Boltzmann machines;field programmable gate arrays;floating point arithmetic;learning (artificial intelligence);multilayer perceptrons","resource efficient arithmetic effects;RBM neural network solution quality;MNIST;restricted Boltzmann machine deep belief networks;hardware accelerator framework;DSP blocks;reconfigurable logic;IEEE floating point representation;DSP slices;reduced precision fixed point format arithmetic;MLP-BP neural network training;FPGA designs","","9","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These models trade a strong prior model of the shape and appearance of the left ventricle for a statistical model whose parameters can be learned using a manually segmented data set (this set is commonly known as the training set). The trouble is that such statistical model is usually quite complex, requiring a large number of parameters that can be robustly learned only if the training set is sufficiently large. The difficulty in obtaining large training sets is currently a major roadblock for the further exploration of statistical models in medical image analysis problems, such as the automatic left ventricle segmentation. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised self-training model that reduces the need of large training sets for estimating the parameters of statistical models. This model is initially trained with a small set of manually segmented images, and for each new test sequence, the system reestimates the model parameters incrementally without any further manual intervention. We show that state-of-the-art segmentation results can be achieved with training sets containing 50 annotated examples for the problem of left ventricle segmentation from ultrasound data.","","","10.1109/ISBI.2011.5872638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5872638","Segmentation of the left ventricle of the heart;semi-supervised training;self-training;deep neural networks;optimization algorithms","Training;Image segmentation;Manuals;Data models;Heart;Ultrasonic imaging;Shape","data analysis;echocardiography;image segmentation;image sequences;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;parameter estimation;pattern recognition;statistical analysis","semisupervised self-training model;image segmentation;left ventricle;heart ultrasound dataset;statistical pattern recognition model;image sequence;parameter estimation","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The assessment-led system presupposes a system in which the processes of assessment, instruction (materials and methods), and learning interact so as to obtain the goals of the curriculum. If any of the links are broken in the system there is no reason why those goals may be obtained other than arbitrarily. Assessment lead curricula are characterised by the need to determine objectives (learning outcomes). There is a tendency for curriculum designers to require the attainment of too many outcomes, some of which may be very narrowly prescribed. A conflict exists between syllabus-content and the development of learning skills that will enable 'transfer of learning.' They may also inhibit cognitive development. Curriculum designers should select 'key ' outcomes and concentrate on the domains encompassed by those outcomes. Curriculum design is always a compromise between the ideal and the possible. The 'possible' is dictated by how students learn. The danger of outcomes based approaches to curriculum design is that they will foster surface learning at the expense of deep learning. Curriculum designers should also be prepared to undertake comprehensive evaluation's as face-validity judgements can be misleading. Curriculum designers, therefore, require a comprehensive knowledge of the educational and learning process.","","","10.1109/FIE.1999.839291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=839291","","Light emitting diodes;Problem-solving;Educational institutions;Education;Protocols;Collaboration;Heuristic algorithms;Engineering drawings;Costs;Engineering students","educational courses;teaching","assessment-led curricula design;instructional programme;learning outcomes;objectives;syllabus-content;learning skills;cognitive development;students","","1","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, peer review is proposed as a complement to project-based learning. Students work not only on their project about a chosen topic, but also review peers' projects on distinct topics, providing them with a wider comprehension of the global syllabus of the course. Empirical results of the application of this approach to an actual course on Artificial Intelligence for senior students in Telecommunication Engineering are presented too.

This paper presents a novel approach for extending the ECO framework. We achieve this through two overarching ideas. First, we address a potential major shortcoming of ECO features - the “features” themselves. The so-called ECO features are simply a transformed image that has been unrolled into a large one dimensional vector. We propose employing feature descriptors to extract pertinent information from the ECO imagery. Furthermore, it is our hypothesis that there exists a unique set of transforms for each feature descriptor used on a given problem domain that leads to the descriptors extracting maximal discriminative information. Second, we introduce constraints on each individual's chromosome to promote population diversity and prevent infeasible solutions. We show through experiments that our proposed iECO framework results in, and benefits from, a unique series of transforms for each descriptor being learned and maintaining population diversity.","","","10.1109/CIMSIVP.2014.7013275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7013275","","Sociology;Statistics;Transforms;Feature extraction;Biological cells;Object recognition;Data mining","computer vision;evolutionary computation;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);object recognition;vectors","improved evolution-constructed features framework;iECO features framework;public release;image processing;and computer vision;feature learning;1D vector;pertinent information extraction;ECO imagery;feature descriptors;maximal discriminative information extraction;population diversity promotion;object recognition","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to examine the successful attributes and potential weaknesses of this new management style, the authors prepared four case studies at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (Pasadena, CA) in 1997 and 1998. Based on these case studies, (Cassini, Mars Pathfinder, Mars Global Surveyor, and Deep Space 1), they identified a number of management features that seem to have contributed to the success of the early FBC projects. These features generally involve simplification, standardization and the use of commercially available components and talents. They also pointed out that most of these features had potential downsides, and they expressed some concerns about the long-term viability of some of these features. The recent failures of two Mars missions have also shown the limitations of this mode of operations. Therefore, in the future, some of these features may have to be revisited to account better for risks and uncertainties.

While the lecture (40% of class time) and topic exploration (30% of class time) components could be transformed with standard approaches to the hybrid on-campus/distance education with streaming class video format, the transformation of the highly interactive paper critique discussions (30% of class time), which are crucial for developing a deep understanding of the course content, proved challenging. Three different forms of the paper critique discussion were tested and evaluated: 1) in-class discussion (with distance students visiting the campus or viewing the video of the recorded discussion), 2) asynchronous Web-based discussion board, and 3) synchronous Web-based live chat. The two course formats as well as the different forms of the paper critique discussion in the hybrid course format were evaluated through extensive student surveys and interviews. The results indicate that student attitudes were approximately equally positive toward both course formats. There was a tendency for the asynchronous discussions to be perceived more positively in terms of learning effectiveness and effectiveness of interaction with the peers than the live chat discussion, while the live chat was preferred in terms of interaction with the instructor.

They are the only designs capable of meaningful planning or foresight. They are also the designs which have led to the most exciting real-world applications in recent years. Within the field of optimization over time, two classes of design have proven useful in practice: (1) direct optimization, using generalized backpropagation to calculate derivatives of utility or performance or cost: and (2) adaptive critic designs, which approximate dynamic programming. After a brief review of neurocontrol and an explanation of reinforcement learning, the author asks what implications these designs have for the understanding of the human mind. He argues that this new mathematics is fully compatible with older deep insights into the human mind, due to humanistic thinkers East and West. There is no real conflict between new ideas from neural network theory or physics and deep, classical ideas from Eastern and Western cultures; in fact, the new ideas may provide a basis for helping understand and appreciate the roots of the classical ideas at a deeper level.<>","","","10.1109/ICSMC.1992.271798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=271798","","Neural networks;Humans;Mathematics;Learning;Dynamic programming;Adaptive systems;Psychology;Intelligent networks;Artificial neural networks;Sensor systems","backpropagation;biocybernetics;neural nets;neurophysiology;optimisation","utility derivatives;Eastern cultures;human mind;humanistic insight;reinforcement learning;optimization designs;backpropagation;adaptive critic designs;dynamic programming;neurocontrol;Western cultures","","5","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Designing and enhancing a systems engineering training and development program","P. N. Trudeau","MITRE Institute, MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA, USA","2010 IEEE International Systems Conference","","2010","","","35","54","The MITRE Institute, the Training and Development (T&D) organization of the MITRE Corporation, is in the process of designing and enhancing its systems engineering (SE) T&D program. This long-term, strategic program is intended to complement an existing deep, self-selection, internal catalog program and an on-site Masters Degree program in systems engineering. The program direction and design are driven by a competency model that focuses on behaviors of successful SEs at MITRE. The program horizontally integrates and blends many T&D approaches at the same program level, including technical, non-technical, and e-Learning courses; student and manager assessments; customized on-the-job projects; group work and networking; a focused training resource database; student manager commitment through an individual development plan (IDP); and a certification option. The program integrates concepts vertically by replication of content that is considered important on multiple, or all levels of the program, such as enterprise systems engineering, risk, team development, and persuasion and influence. The SE T&D program, called SEworks, will have three tiers, roughly in line with MITRE's technical career ladder, with the purpose of ensuring that SEs at certain levels in their career are armed with and capable of using various SE skills, methodologies, and techniques on the job, and also capable of tailoring them to their projects. Kilpatrick level 1 and 2 measurement approaches will be used in various aspects of the instructor-led and e-Learning courses. Long-term, programmatic measurements on behavioral changes (Kilpatrick Level 3) will focus on two approaches. One approach and goal is an 80% improvement of competencies that students focused on for their on-the-job projects, as determined through manager assessments. The other approach is a long-term trend analysis on our cross corporate assessments of students in the SEworks program. With substantial senior manager input and support, The MITRE Institute has initiated a long-term, strategic internal SE T&D program, which is designed to complement existing deep SE catalog and onsite MS in SE degree programs. The main purpose is to enhance the SE behaviors and skills of MITRE staff, a core competency of the MITRE Corporation, and thereby allow the staff to deliver better products to our customers.","","","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2010.5482479","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5482479","systems enginering;training and development (T&D);education;competency model;measurement;training design","Design engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Management training;Project management;Electronic learning;Resource management;Engineering profession;Process design;On the job training;Databases","computer aided instruction;educational courses;systems engineering;training","systems engineering;training-and-development program;MITRE Institute;masters degree program;technical course;nontechnical course;e-learning course;individual development plan;certification option;student manager commitment;training resource database;SEworks;Kilpatrick measurement approach;competency model","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First we verify the eligibility of autoencoder by following classical spectral information based classification and use autoencoders with different depth to classify hyperspectral image. Further in the proposed framework, we combine PCA on spectral dimension and autoencoder on the other two spatial dimensions to extract spectral-spatial information for classification.

We interpret this as evidence of a deep connection between reversibility and safe behaviour.

The inputs are the state variables, and the outputs are the Q-values for each action. It is tuned to update and store the Q-table. The upper layer watches the activity in the lower layer to identify the group of nodes that are activated when some action in the lower layer obtains a high reward from the environment. In this way, new symbols emerge that are embedded in the lower layer to speed up the learning. Model-B is extended so as to learn more complex concepts quickly.

This revolution has reshaped the lift sciences and given us a deep understanding of DNA sequences, RNA synthesis and the generation of proteins. This process can be represented as gene expression of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems. In this paper, the annealing robust fuzzy basis function (ARFBF) is proposed to improve the problems of fuzzy basis function for modeling of gene expression of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems with outliers. Firstly, the support vector regression (SVR) approach is proposed to determine the initial structure of ARFBF. Because of a SVR approach is equivalent to solving a linear constrained quadratic programming problem under a fixed structure of SVR, the number of hidden nodes, the initial parameters and the initial weights of ARFBF are easy obtained via the SVR approach. Secondly, the results of SVR are used as initial structure in ARFBF. At the same time, an annealing robust learning algorithm (ARLA) is used as the learning algorithm for ARFBF, and applied to adjust the parameters as well as weights of ARFBF. That is, an ARLA is proposed to overcome the problems of initialization and the cut-off points in the robust learning algorithm. Hence, when an initial structure of ARFBF is determined by a SVR approach, the ARFBF with ARLA have fast convergence speed and robust against outliers for the modeling of molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems.","","","10.1109/FUZZY.2007.4295376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4295376","","Annealing;Robustness;Fuzzy systems;Feedback loop;Biology computing;Gene expression;Biological system modeling;Bioinformatics;DNA;Sequences","biology computing;constraint handling;DNA;feedback;fuzzy neural nets;genetics;learning (artificial intelligence);linear programming;molecular biophysics;proteins;quadratic programming;radial basis function networks;support vector machines","annealing robust fuzzy basis function;molecular autoregulatory feedback loop systems;bioinformatics;lift sciences;DNA sequences;RNA synthesis;protein generation;gene expression modeling;support vector regression;SVR approach;linear constrained quadratic programming problem;annealing robust learning algorithm","","4","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Classical HTM learning is mainly unsupervised, and once training is completed, the network structure is frozen, thus making further training (i.e., incremental learning) quite critical. In this letter, we develop a novel technique for HTM (incremental) supervised learning based on gradient descent error minimization. We prove that error backpropagation can be naturally and elegantly implemented through native HTM message passing based on belief propagation. Our experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage training approach composed of unsupervised pretraining and supervised refinement is very effective (both accurate and efficient).

Such abstractions, in addition to providing valuable design intuition, also enable highly efficient and scalable system-level simulation. However, given a SPICE-level description for a subsystem such as a latch, it is a challenge to come up with a discrete, symbol-level abstraction that accurately captures its continuous-time dynamics. Indeed, the manual construction of such an abstraction requires deep knowledge and understanding of the operation of the module in question; moreover, it is very time-consuming, tedious, error-prone and not easily scalable to larger designs. In recent work [1], we adapted methods from computational learning theory to develop an automated technique, DAE2FSM, that produces binary finite state machine (FSM) abstractions of non-linear analog/mixed-signal (AMS) circuits. In the present paper, we demonstrate the application of the DAE2FSM technique to automatically derive FSM abstractions for a mixed-signal communications circuit component, namely a current mode latch (CML) designed in IBM's 90nm LP process technology. We show that the FSMs learned by DAE2FSM not only capture the essence of the latch's behaviour during normal conditions, but also faithfully mimic its behaviour under adverse operating conditions (e.g., under lowered supply voltages). Moreover, in addition to a stand-alone CML, we also generate FSMs for cascades of two and three latches (such topologies are used in the design of power-efficient, bit-error optimised analog-to-digital converters). In spite of the inherent non-linearity of such systems, and in spite of the pronounced “analog-ness” of the waveforms in question, our FSM abstractions are able to produce discrete-time symbol sequences that closely match the data points obtained by sampling from continuous-time SPICE simulations.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2012.6289114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6289114","","Latches;Clocks;SPICE;Solid modeling;Predictive models;Communication systems;Analytical models","circuit simulation;CMOS logic circuits;continuous time systems;digital communication;discrete time systems;electronic design automation;finite state machines;flip-flops;learning (artificial intelligence);logic design;mixed analogue-digital integrated circuits;SPICE","fully automated technique;FSM abstractions;nonideal latches;communication system design;discrete symbolic behavioural abstraction;scalable system-level simulation;SPICE-level subsystem description;discrete symbol-level abstraction;continuous-time dynamics;computational learning theory;DAE2FSM technique;binary finite state machine abstraction;nonlinear analog-mixed signal circuits;nonlinear AMS circuits;mixed-signal communication circuit component;current mode latch design;LP process technology;latch behaviour;stand-alone CML;system nonlinearity;discrete-time symbol sequences;continuous-time SPICE simulation;size 90 nm","","","3","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We employ a deep temporal generative model for unsupervised learning of a shared representation across multiple modalities with time varying data. The temporal generative model takes into account short term temporal phenomena and allows for filling in missing data by generating data within or across modalities. The hybrid model involves augmenting the temporal generative model with a temporal discriminative model for event detection, and classification, which enables modeling long range temporal dynamics. We evaluate our approach on audio-visual datasets (AVEC, AVLetters, and CUAVE) and demonstrate its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art.","","","10.1109/WACV.2014.6836053","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836053","","Data models;Hidden Markov models;Hybrid power systems;Hafnium;Joints;Vectors;Computational modeling","sensor fusion;unsupervised learning","multimodal fusion;dynamic hybrid models;discriminative classifiers;multimodal event detection;generative likelihood based classifiers;joint feature representation;temporal generative model;temporal discriminative model;unsupervised learning;audio-visual datasets","","16","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Avoiding system downtime and loss of revenue dictates a fast and efficient root-cause analysis process. Operator practice and academic research have shown that about 80% of failures in such systems have recurrent causes; therefore, significant efficiency gains can be achieved by automating their identification. In this paper, we present a novel approach to modelling features of log files. This model offers a compact representation of log data that can be efficiently extracted from large amounts of monitoring data. We also use decision-tree classifiers to learn and classify symptoms of recurrent faults. This representation enables automated fault matching and, in addition, enables human investigators to understand manifestations of failure easily. Our model does not require any access to application source code, a specification of log messages, or deep application knowledge. We evaluate our proposal using fault-injection experiments against other proposals in the field. First, we show that the features needed for symptom definition can be extracted more efficiently than does related work. Second, we show that these features enable an accurate classification of recurrent faults using only standard machine learning techniques. This enables us to identify accurately up to 78% of the faults in our evaluation data set.","","","10.1109/INM.2011.5990536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5990536","","Servers;Manuals;Particle measurements;Atmospheric measurements;Monitoring","business data processing;data mining;data structures;decision trees;fault diagnosis;learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification","unstructured log file mining;recurrent fault diagnosis;enterprise software systems;automated root-cause analysis;revenue loss;decision-tree classifiers;automated fault matching;fault-injection experiments;machine learning techniques;log data representation","","7","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we look into the potential use of motion capture data for the quantitative analysis of motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD). The standard of care, human observer-based assessments of the motor symptoms, can be very subjective and are often inadequate for tracking mild symptoms. Motion capture systems, on the other hand, can potentially provide more objective and quantitative assessments. In this pilot study, we perform full-body motion capture of Parkinson's patients with deep brain stimulator off-drugs and with stimulators on and off. Our experimental results indicate that the quantitative measure on spatio-temporal statistics learnt from the motion capture data reveal distinctive differences between mild and severe symptoms. We used a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for discriminating mild vs. severe symptoms with an average accuracy of approximately 90%. Finally, we conclude that motion capture technology could potentially be an accurate, reliable and effective tool for statistical data mining on motor symptoms related to PD. This would enable us to devise more effective ways to track the progression of neurodegenerative movement disorders.","","","10.1109/IEMBS.2011.6091674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6091674","Parkinson's Disease (PD);movement disorder;motion capture (mocap);Support Vector Machine (SVM);deep brain stimulation (DBS);biomechanics and robotics","Support vector machines;Parkinson's disease;Stability analysis;Satellite broadcasting;Trajectory;Accuracy","bioelectric phenomena;biomechanics;diseases;drugs;medical computing;motion measurement;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;support vector machines","quantitative motor symptom measurement;Parkinson's disease;full body motion capture data;optical motion capture system portability;optical motion capture system affordability;motor symptom quantitative analysis;deep brain stimulator;drugs;support vector machine;SVM classifier;mild symptoms;severe symptoms;neurodegenerative movement disorders","Acceleration;Aged;Artificial Intelligence;Data Mining;Disease Progression;Equipment Design;Female;Fourier Analysis;Gait;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Models, Statistical;Motion;Motor Skills;Parkinson Disease;Parkinson Disease;Postural Balance;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Support Vector Machines;Tremor","21","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We perform an in-depth evaluation of such techniques as a front-end for noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR). The proposed separation front-end consists of two stages. The first stage removes additive noise via time-frequency masking. The second stage addresses channel mismatch and the distortions introduced by the first stage; a non-linear function is learned that maps the masked spectral features to their clean counterpart. Results show that the proposed front-end substantially improves ASR performance when the acoustic models are trained in clean conditions. We also propose a diagonal feature discriminant linear regression (dFDLR) adaptation that can be performed on a per-utterance basis for ASR systems employing deep neural networks and HMM. Results show that dFDLR consistently improves performance in all test conditions. Surprisingly, the best average results are obtained when dFDLR is applied to models trained using noisy log-Mel spectral features from the multi-condition training set. With no channel mismatch, the best results are obtained when the proposed speech separation front-end is used along with multi-condition training using log-Mel features followed by dFDLR adaptation.

Adopting the global linear least-squares (‘ubercal’) approach developed for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we derive flat-field corrections for all observing runs, which indicate that the original sky flats were non-uniform by up to 0.13 mag peak-to-valley in z band, and by up to half of that amount in BVR. We show that the application of these corrections reduces spatial non-uniformities in corrected exposures to the 0.01–0.02 mag level. We conclude with some lessons learned in applying ubercal to a survey structured very differently from SDSS, with isolated fields, multiple observatories and shift-and-stare rather than drift-scan imaging. Although the size of the error caused by using sky or dome flats is instrument and wavelength dependent, users of wide-field cameras should not assume that it is small. Pipeline developers should facilitate routine application of this procedure, and surveys should include it in their plans from the outset.","","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20458.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8174479","methods: statistical;techniques: photometric;surveys","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Restricted Boltzmann machines are interesting because inference is easy in them and because they have been successfully used as building blocks for training deeper models. We first prove that adding hidden units yields strictly improved modeling power, while a second theorem shows that RBMs are universal approximators of discrete distributions. We then study the question of whether DBNs with more layers are strictly more powerful in terms of representational power.

This course basically teaches the students on how to design microprocessor-based systems.

Teaching and learning the theory of programming is a challenging task since it involves the abstract notions and logical thinking. In addition, they have to have the detailed knowledge on the hardware aspect of the processor. Unfortunately, most of these students adopt a surface approach and tend to accept information passively. They also tend to concentrate only on what will be asked in the examinations and prefer to memorize facts rather than reflecting on the purpose and analyzing the information. They need to adopt a deep approach to learning and interact with the content critically in order to integrate both the hardware and software aspects in their design.

The starting and ending time points of each sub-activity are represented by two latent variables, which are automatically determined during the inference process. We formulate the training problem of the LHM in a latent kernelized SVM framework and develop an efficient cascade inference method to speed up classification. The advantages of our methods come from: 1) LHM models the complex activity with a deep structure, which is decomposed into sub-activities in a coarse-to-fine manner and 2) the starting and ending time points of each segment are adaptively determined to deal with the temporal displacement and duration variation of sub-activity. We conduct experiments on three datasets: 1) the KTH; 2) the Hollywood2; and 3) the Olympic Sports. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the LHM in complex activity classification. With dense features, our LHM achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Hollywood2 dataset and the Olympic Sports dataset.","","","10.1109/TIP.2013.2295753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690150","Activity classification;hierarchical model;deep structure;latent learning;cascade inference","Training;Support vector machines;Hidden Markov models;Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Inference algorithms","image classification;inference mechanisms;sport;support vector machines;video signal processing","Olympic Sports;Hollywood2;KTH;temporal displacement;cascade inference method;latent kernelized SVM framework;training problem;inference process;video segment;tree-structure;complex activity decomposition;LHM;temporal structure modeling;complex activity classification;latent hierarchical model","","58","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Developments in underwater technologies — Indian scenario","M. A. Atmanand","National Institute of Ocean Technology, Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, Chennai, India","2013 IEEE International Underwater Technology Symposium (UT)","","2013","","","1","5","With a large coastline of approximately 7600 km surrounded by two major ocean basins on both sides of peninsular India as Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, drained by major river basins from Himalayas, there are multidimensional requirement of underwater technologies to cater the country's demand. With increased thrust on underwater technology in India during the past 15 years, it is imperative to put forth India's development in the frontier area of underwater technologies. Under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, Government of India, National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) is leading the frontier areas of underwater technologies. The Institutes like Central Mechanical Engineering Research Institute and Indian Institute of Technologies are also contributing in a minor way. Under International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulations, Government of India registered as a contractor on 17th August 1987. India was allocated 150,000 sq. km area in Central Indian Ocean Basin for exploration of manganese nodules. After detailed exploration, 50% of this area has been relinquished to the ISA. While other Institutes in India are responsible for metal extraction, NIOT is responsible for developing technology for mining of manganese nodules from the deep seabed. To harness the non-renewable resources ranging from placer deposits at water depth of 100 m, gas hydrates at 1000 m, hydrothermal sulphides at 3000 m to polymetallic nodules at 5400 m water depth, various technologies were developed and proven in the field. To cater to the disaster management, range of observation systems, drifters and seafloor based observations are being developed and data collection and dissemination is in place. This paper deals with the achievements in the development of underwater vehicles and systems during the past 15 years in India in the civilian front. The major technologies developed, like the Deep sea crawler (512 m) for mining of manganese nodules, In-situ soil tester (5462 m) for measurement of in-situ soil property on the sea bed, Work Class Remotely Operated Vehicle (5289 m) for general purpose, including assistance in nodule mining, Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (200 m) for shallow water and operation in polar regions, being developed, and drifter buoys for collection of ocean data are explained in detail. The challenges involved in design, development, testing and issues faced during the sea trials of the various systems and lessons learnt are explained in this paper.","","","10.1109/UT.2013.6519830","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519830","","Oceans;Tsunami;Sea measurements;Crawlers;Marine vehicles;Manganese;Data mining","hydrocarbon reservoirs;oceanographic regions;oceanographic techniques;underwater vehicles","underwater technologies;Indian scenario;peninsular India;Bay-of-Bengal;Arabian Sea;Indian coastline;river basins;Himalayas;multidimensional requirement;Ministry-of-Earth Sciences;Government-of-India;National Institute-of-Ocean Technology;International Seabed Authority regulations;AD 1987 08 17;central Indian ocean basin;manganese nodules;ISA;metal extraction;NIOT;developing technology;deep seabed;nonrenewable resources;observation systems;disaster management;gas hydrates;hydrothermal sulphides;underwater vehicles;underwater systems;India;deep sea crawler;soil tester;soil property;sea bed;work class remotely operated vehicle;nodule mining;autonomous underwater vehicle;shallow water;polar regions;drifter buoys;ocean data","","2","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Optimal Buffer Management Policies for Delay Tolerant Networks","A. Krifa; C. Barakat; T.

Propagation delays may also be long due to the operational environment (e.g. deep space, underwater). In order to achieve data delivery in such challenging networking environments, researchers have proposed the use of store-carry-and-forward protocols: there, a node may store a message in its buffer and carry it along for long periods of time, until an appropriate forwarding opportunity arises. Additionally, multiple message replicas are often propagated to increase delivery probability. This combination of long-term storage and replication imposes a high storage overhead on untethered nodes (e.g. handhelds). Thus, efficient buffer management policies are necessary to decide which messages should be discarded, when node buffers are operated close to their capacity. In this paper, we propose efficient buffer management policies for delay tolerant networks. We show that traditional buffer management policies like drop-tail or drop-front fail to consider all relevant information in this context and are, thus, sub-optimal. Using the theory of encounter-based message dissemination, we propose an optimal buffer management policy based on global knowledge about the network. Our policy can be tuned either to minimize the average delivery delay or to maximize the average delivery rate. Finally, we introduce a distributed algorithm that uses statistical learning to approximate the global knowledge required by the the optimal algorithm, in practice. Using simulations based on a synthetic mobility model and real mobility traces, we show that our buffer management policy based on statistical learning successfully approximates the performance of the optimal policy in all considered scenarios. At the same time, our policy outperforms existing ones in terms of both average delivery rate and delivery delay.","","","10.1109/SAHCN.2008.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4557763","","Disruption tolerant networking;Wireless networks;Propagation delay;Space technology;Buffer storage;Statistical learning;IP networks;Routing protocols;Computer network management;Energy management","delays;telecommunication network management","optimal buffer management policies;delay tolerant networks;propagation delays;multiple message replicas;encounter-based message dissemination;statistical learning;global knowledge;store-carry-and-forward protocols","","144","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results suggest that, contrary to the common belief, a DPI classifier and an SVM-based one can have comparable computational costs.

A new concept for course design which uses the consensus decision-making process involving different stakeholders in the learning process is exposed, and the considerations required to implement this approach in a power system analysis course are described. To examine the effect of this approach, three different course evaluations were conducted by querying the students during different stages of the course. These evaluations show that most of the students find a benefit for their learning in the implementation of CAT within the new course design. These observations are supported by a comparison of the students' performance with the new course design with an antecessor course. Finally, the Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire (R-SPQ-2F) was utilized to identify the students that adopted a deep or surface approach during the course. During this process, several limitations which affect the quality of the results from the R-SPQ-2F questionnaire were identified. In view of these limitations, and to extract relevant information from R-SPQ-2F, a ranking algorithm was developed. This information helps selecting relevant student feedback which can be used to improve the course design in subsequent deliveries.","","","10.1109/ICELIE.2012.6471154","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6471154","Power System Analysis;Constructive-Alignment Theory;Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire","","decision making;educational courses;power engineering education;power systems","student feedback;ranking algorithm;R-SPQ-2F;two-factor study process questionnaire;course evaluation;consensus decision-making process;consensus-based course design process;consensus model;power system analysis course;constructive alignment theory","","1","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent improvements to the state of the art on standard benchmarks such as MIT1003 have been achieved mostly by incrementally adding more and more hand-tuned features (such as car or face detectors) to existing models. In contrast, we here follow an entirely automatic data-driven approach that performs a large-scale search for optimal features. We identify those instances of a richly-parameterized bio-inspired model family (hierarchical neuromorphic networks) that successfully predict image saliency. Because of the high dimensionality of this parameter space, we use automated hyperparameter optimization to efficiently guide the search. The optimal blend of such multilayer features combined with a simple linear classifier achieves excellent performance on several image saliency benchmarks. Our models outperform the state of the art on MIT1003, on which features and classifiers are learned. Without additional training, these models generalize well to two other image saliency data sets, Toronto and NUSEF, despite their different image content. Finally, our algorithm scores best of all the 23 models evaluated to date on the MIT300 saliency challenge, which uses a hidden test set to facilitate an unbiased comparison.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909754","saliency;deep learning;hyperparameter optimization","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Benchmark testing;Visualization;Predictive models;Image color analysis;Optimization","bio-inspired materials;feature extraction;image classification;optimisation","large-scale optimization;hierarchical features;saliency prediction;natural images;hand-crafted features;master saliency map;local image conspicuity encoding;standard benchmarks;MIT1003;hand-tuned features;automatic data-driven approach;optimal features;richly-parameterized bio-inspired model;parameter space;automated hyperparameter optimization;multilayer features;linear classifier;image saliency data sets;Toronto;NUSEF;image content","","132","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Lasenby","NA; NA; NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","","2014","441","2","1741","1759","We present the first public release of our generic neural network training algorithm, called SKYNET. This efficient and robust machine learning tool is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks, including autoencoders, for use in a wide range of supervised and unsupervised learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. SKYNET uses a ‘pre-training’ method to obtain a set of network parameters that has empirically been shown to be close to a good solution, followed by further optimization using a regularized variant of Newton's method, where the level of regularization is determined and adjusted automatically; the latter uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimize using standard backpropagation techniques. SKYNET employs convergence criteria that naturally prevent overfitting, and also includes a fast algorithm for estimating the accuracy of network outputs. The utility and flexibility of SKYNET are demonstrated by application to a number of toy problems, and to astronomical problems focusing on the recovery of structure from blurred and noisy images, the identification of gamma-ray bursters, and the compression and denoising of galaxy images.

Focusing on modes of interaction in this work, we examined the effect of different motion types on the knowledge acquisition of users in various virtual environments. For our study we chose a simple memorization task as approximation of low cognitive knowledge acquirement. We hypothesized motion types and immersion levels influence memorization performance in virtual environments. The memorization task was conducted in two virtual environments with different levels of immersion: A high-immersive Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a low-immersive desktop virtual environment. Two motion types in virtual environments were explored: Physical and virtual walking. In the CAVE physical walking was implemented by using motion capturing and virtual walking was realized using a joystick-like input device.

While laboratory experiments for testing an emotion recognition system fail to evoke fully naturalistic responses, ambulatory assessment carries its own ambiguities when it comes to the nature of the emotion elicited and context awareness.

These features open opportunities for users to introduce polluted content, or simply pollution, into the system. For instance, spammers may post an unrelated video as response to a popular one, aiming at increasing the likelihood of the response being viewed by a larger number of users. Moreover, content promoters may try to gain visibility to a specific video by posting a large number of (potentially unrelated) responses to boost the rank of the responded video, making it appear in the top lists maintained by the system. Content pollution may jeopardize the trust of users on the system, thus compromising its success in promoting social interactions. In spite of that, the available literature is very limited in providing a deep understanding of this problem. In this paper, we address the issue of detecting video spammers and promoters. Towards that end, we first manually build a test collection of real YouTube users, classifying them as spammers, promoters, and legitimate users. Using our test collection, we provide a characterization of content, individual, and social attributes that help distinguish each user class. We then investigate the feasibility of using supervised classification algorithms to automatically detect spammers and promoters, and assess their effectiveness in our test collection. While our classification approach succeeds at separating spammers and promoters from legitimate users, the high cost of manually labeling vast amounts of examples compromises its full potential in realistic scenarios. For this reason, we further propose an active learning approach that automatically chooses a set of examples to label, which is likely to provide the highest amount of information, drastically reducing the amount of required training data while maintaining comparable classification effectiveness.","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2011.2173799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6093756","Promoter;social media;social networks;spammer;video promotion;video response;video spam","YouTube;Pollution;Tin;Electronic mail;Crawlers;Measurement;Labeling","learning (artificial intelligence);pattern classification;social networking (online)","practical detection;content promoters;online video sharing systems;YouTube;polluted content;video spammers detection;supervised classification algorithm;active learning approach","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Simulation;Decision Support Techniques;Information Storage and Retrieval;Internet;Models, Theoretical;Online Systems;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Video Recording","13","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, batteries are expensive and have a limited life time. Having a deep understanding of how batteries operate in working situations is crucial to designing advanced control mechanisms. Battery performance and life time is highly dependent on how it is used and also on environmental working conditions. While batteries have been extensively studied through model-based approaches, there is no previous work about modeUng behavior based on data analytic methods. In this paper, we propose an integrated data-driven framework to study the behavior of battery systems in a grid, based on data mining techniques. The proposed method provides a high level characterization of battery behavior and online parameter estimation using supervised and unsupervised learning methods. This work can be used in intelligent control systems and would help administrators to know what is happening inside a battery.","","","10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2014.6873891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6873891","","Batteries;US Department of Defense;System-on-chip;Clustering algorithms;Asia;Discharges (electric);Degradation","battery storage plants;data analysis;data mining;intelligent control;sustainable development;unsupervised learning","data mining;sustainable energy systems;battery life time;data analytic methods;battery systems;unsupervised learning;intelligent control systems","","1","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This competitive algorithm-based framework is particularly attractive for applications in which there is a large degree of uncertainty in the statistics and behavior of the signals of interest. Problems of prediction, equalization and adaptive filtering can be cast in a manner intimately related to repeated game playing as a game between a player, who can observe the outcomes from a large class of competiting algorithms, and an adversarial nature that produces the observations. The player in such a formulation attempts to outperform the best “expert” in this class, while nature is free to select the outcomes to defeat the player. Min-max strategies for the player naturally arise with corresponding bounds on performance that can be obtained with relatively little knowledge or contraints on the outcomes. This paper reviews the history of these methods, together with a number of robust adaptive filtering and prediction techniques that have been developed. Examples of competition classes comprising a finite number of adaptive filtering algortihms are considered along with examples of continuous classes of competing algorithms. Methods for incorporating time variation and nonlinearity explicity into the competition classes are also described.","","","10.1109/ISWCS.2010.5624274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5624274","","Signal processing algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Adaptation model;Predictive models;Signal processing;Context;Games","adaptive filters;game theory;learning (artificial intelligence);minimax techniques;signal processing","competitive algorithm approach;machine learning;game theory;signal processing applications;competitive algorithm-based framework;game playing;competiting algorithms;min-max strategy;robust adaptive filtering;prediction techniques","","2","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most classifiers proposed in literature are based on machine learning techniques and consider each flow independently of previous source activity (per-flow analysis). In this paper, we propose to use specific per-source information to improve classification accuracy: the sequence of starting times of flows generated by single sources may be analyzed along time to estimate peculiar statistical parameters, in our case the exponent α of the power law f-α that approximates the PSD of their counting process. In our method, this measurement is used to train a classifier in addition to the lengths of the first packets of the flows. In our experiments, considering this additional per-source information yielded the same accuracy as using only per-flow data, but observing fewer packets in each flow and thus allowing a quicker response.

This new NN-based classifier with shared hidden layers streamlines the time-consuming work needed in training multiple individual classifiers separately, i.e., one for a specific phoneme, and learns common feature representation via the shared hidden layers. Its improved performance, when compared with independently trained, phoneme specific classifiers, is verified on a testing database of isolated English words recorded by non-native English learners. Compared with the conventional Goodness of Pronunciation (GOP)-based approach, the NN-based LR classifier improves the precision and recall by 37.1% and 11.7% (absolute), respectively.

It impinges on a large proportion of the population and affects government service policies and people's life quality. Typical welfare countries, such as Australia and Canada, have accumulated a huge amount of social security and social welfare data. Emerging business issues such as fraudulent outlays, and customer service and performance improvements challenge existing policies, as well as techniques and systems including data matching and business intelligence reporting systems. The need for a deep understanding of customers and customer-government interactions through advanced data analytics has been increasingly recognized by the community at large. So far, however, no substantial work on the mining of social security and social welfare data has been reported. For the first time in data mining and machine learning, and to the best of our knowledge, this paper draws a comprehensive overall picture and summarizes the corresponding techniques and illustrations to analyze social security/welfare data, namely, social security data mining (SSDM), based on a thorough review of a large number of related references from the past half century. In particular, we introduce an SSDM framework, including business and research issues, social security/welfare services and data, as well as challenges, goals, and tasks in mining social security/welfare data.

This study looked at the alignment between student approaches to learning and the environment developed, in particular student disposition towards deep or surface learning. Although evaluation shows the student cohort achieved significantly higher scores in their assessment that those of previous offerings, it was notable that students who reported themselves as adopting surface approaches were less comfortable with the environment. However, they still exhibited deep learning characteristics when observed in a subsequent course. While an understanding of student learning is fundamental in developing learning environments, alignment between discipline and learning is also critical in educating competent practitioners. Results of this study show that students placed in an environment that enables them to model professional practice, and reflect on that modelling, should be much better prepared for the workplace.","","","10.1109/CSEET.2007.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4271604","","Software engineering;Information technology;Information analysis;Employment;Organizational aspects;Collaborative work;Computer industry;Books;Industrial training;Technological innovation","computer science education;educational aids;software engineering","professional practice;IT graduates;formal education;action research project;software engineering;cognitive apprenticeship;problem-based learning;surface approaches;subsequent course","","7","36","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ghosh","The University of Texas, USA","2006 18th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI'06)","","2006","","","261","264","All cultures and nations have long recognized that creativity is the ultimate cause of the quantum leaps in virtually every discipline of knowledge and the quiet and invisible force behind all progress of human civilization. Leading thinkers across all disciplines have advocated the importance of creativity and consistently ranked it well beyond intelligence. In the recent literature, creativity has been clarified as a phenomenon that categorically differs from intelligence in that the ideas that result from it may not be deduced by applying current reasoning techniques on the state-of-the-art knowledge. Thus, creativity transcends intelligence. Throughout history, close examination reveals that deep sadness and profound grief have always been associated with every creative activity and every individual engaged in a creative invention or discovery. This paper pioneers the analytical examination of a key question, namely, is the apparent association between creativity and sadness mere coincidence or does there exist a scientific reasoning, arising from a deep and fundamental connection between the two concepts? The potential benefits of this exercise, if successful, are two-fold. First, it encapsulates a systematic attempt to resolve a deep intellectual curiosity that has intrigued society for millennia. Second, as a practical benefit, a careful understanding of the theory of the underlying processes may help us analyze how best to nurture the course of any given creative activity and limit the grief or sadness so it does not spin out of control and consume the individual, denying civilization, today and for the future, the enormous benefits that may follow from the inventions and discoveries. It is an undeniable fact that sadness may affect every individual, at one time or another and this paper does not focus on assessing whether sadness is a prelude to a creative invention or discovery. Instead, its objective is to examine whether creativity, by nature, triggers a counter-posing force that leads to profound grief; or whether creativity and sadness are so intimately intertwined in their seat in human beings that evoking creativity automatically triggers intense grief","","","10.1109/ICTAI.2006.113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4031907","","Humans;History;Computer science;Quantum computing;Testing;Artificial intelligence;Birds;Learning;Writing;Helicopters","artificial intelligence;cognition;human factors","human beings;human civilization;intelligence;reasoning techniques;scientific reasoning;creative invention;counter-posing force","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a robust framework using a hybrid I-vector and deep neural network (DNN) system to perform anchorperson detection based on audio streams of video content. The proposed system first applies I-vector to extract speaker identity features from the audio data. With the extracted speaker identity features, a DNN classifier is then used to verify the claimed anchorperson identity. In addition, subspace feature normalization (SFN) is incorporated into the hybrid system for robust feature extraction to compensate the audio mismatch issues caused by recording devices. An anchorperson verification experiment was conducted to evaluate the equal error rate (EER) of the proposed hybrid system. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the state-of-the-art hybrid I-vector and support vector machine (SVM) system.

However, training the necessary acoustic models can be a challenge, since the available training data usually lacks verbatim orthographic transcriptions. If there are approximate transcriptions, this problem can be overcome using light supervision methods. In this paper, we perform speech recognition on broadcasts of Weatherview, BBC's daily weather report, as a first step towards automatic subtitling. For training, we use a large set of past broadcasts, using their manually created subtitles as approximate transcriptions. We discuss and and compare two different light supervision methods, applying them to this data. The best training set finally obtained with these methods is used to create a hybrid deep neural network-based recognition system, which yields high recognition accuracies on three separate Weatherview evaluation sets.","","","10.1109/ASRU.2013.6707772","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6707772","Light supervision;Transcription;Segmentation;Acoustic Model Training;Subtitling","Training;Acoustics;Speech;Training data;Weather forecasting;Speech recognition","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;speech recognition;weather forecasting","supervised automatic subtitling;weather forecasts;automatic speech recognition;ASR;light supervision methods;Weatherview;daily weather report;approximate transcriptions;hybrid deep neural network-based recognition system","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the standard training procedure for CD-DNN-HMM, the Gaussian mixture models (GMM) based ASR system has to be firstly built to pre-segment the training data and to define the CD states as the targets for DNN. In this paper, we propose a novel decision tree based state tying procedure, in which, the state embeddings derived from DNN are used and clustered to minimize the sum-of-squared error. Thus, the GMM is not a necessary part to define the targets for CD-DNN. Besides, we introduce a training procedure for CD-DNN-HMM, where, the forward backward algorithm is used for context independent (CI) DNN-HMM training, and the proposed state tying approach is applied to define the CD-DNN targets. Experiments were conducted on a 30-hour Chinese broadcast news speech database and the results demonstrate that the proposed DNN based state tying approach yielded comparable performance to the GMM based one.","","","10.1109/ISCSLP.2014.6936637","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6936637","decision tree based state tying;DNN embedding;speech recognition;clustering","Hidden Markov models;Acoustics;Decision trees;Training;Speech recognition;Speech;Context","decision trees;hidden Markov models;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;pattern clustering;speech recognition","decision tree;DNN derived embeddings;context dependent;deep neural network;hidden Markov model;state tying procedure;clustering;sum-of-squared error minimization;CD-DNN-HMM training procedure;forward backward algorithm;context independent DNN-HMM training;CI DNN-HMM;Chinese broadcast news speech database;automatic speech recognition;ASR systems","","4","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By concentrating on activation clusters in RNNs, while not throwing away the continuous state space network dynamics, we extract predictive models that we call neural prediction machines (NPMs). When RNNs with sigmoid activation functions are initialized with small weights (a common technique in the RNN community), the clusters of recurrent activations emerging prior to training are indeed meaningful and correspond to Markov prediction contexts. In this case, the extracted NPMs correspond to a class of Markov models, called variable memory length Markov models (VLMMs). In order to appreciate how much information has really been induced during the training, the RNN performance should always be compared with that of VLMMs and NPMs extracted before training as the ""null"" base models. Our arguments are supported by experiments on a chaotic symbolic sequence and a context-free language with a deep recursive structure.","","","10.1109/TNN.2003.820839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1263574","","Recurrent neural networks;Data mining;Predictive models;State-space methods;Chaos;History;Neural networks;Information processing;Iterative algorithms;Automata","recurrent neural nets;Markov processes;context-free languages;learning (artificial intelligence);neural net architecture;pattern clustering","Markovian architectural bias;recurrent neural networks;clustering;recurrent layer;activation clusters;continuous state space network dynamics;predictive models;neural prediction machines;sigmoid activation functions;Markov prediction contexts;variable memory length Markov models;chaotic symbolic sequence;context-free language;deep recursive structure;complex symbolic sequences;information latching problem;iterative function systems","Markov Chains;Neural Networks (Computer)","131","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, a new tendency in the fuzzy modeling that looks for a good balance between interpretability and accuracy is increasing in importance. In fact, recently multi-objective evolutionary algorithms have been applied to improve the difficult trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. In this paper, we focus both on rule learning and fuzzy memberships tuning proposing a technique based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) to design deep-tuned Fuzzy Rule Based Classifier Systems (FRBCSs) from examples. Our technique generates a FRBCS which includes certain operators (known as linguistic hedges or modifiers) able to improve accuracy without losses in interpretability. In our proposal the MOGA is used to learn the FRBCS and to set the operators in order to optimize both model accuracy and metrics of interpretability, compactness and transparency in a single algorithm. The resulting Multi-Objective Genetic Fuzzy System (MOGFS) is evaluated through comparative examples based on well-known data sets in the pattern classification field.","","","10.1109/ISDA.2009.97","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5364737","","Fuzzy systems;Knowledge based systems;Genetic algorithms;Fuzzy sets;Intelligent systems;Telecommunications;Evolutionary computation;Algorithm design and analysis;Proposals;Pattern classification","fuzzy set theory;genetic algorithms;pattern classification","linguistic modifiers;accuracy-interpretability trade-off;multiobjective genetic design;fuzzy rule based systems;fuzzy modeling;multiobjective evolutionary algorithm;rule learning;fuzzy memberships tuning;multiobjective genetic algorithm;deep-tuned fuzzy rule based classifier systems;multiobjective genetic fuzzy system","","3","27","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identifying emerging applications based on well-known port numbers is no longer reliable. While deep packet inspection (DPI) solutions can be accurate, they require constant updates of signatures and become infeasible for encrypted payload especially in multimedia applications (e.g. Skype). Statistical approaches based on machine learning have thus been considered more promising and robust to encryption, privacy, protocol obfuscation, etc. However, the computation complexity of traffic classification using those statistical solutions is high, which prevents them being deployed in systems that need to manage Internet traffic in real time. This paper proposes a FPGA-based parallel architecture to accelerate the statistical identification of multimedia applications while maintaining high classification accuracy. Specifically, we base our design on the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm which has been shown to be one of the most accurate machine learning algorithms for Internet traffic classification. To enable high-rate data streaming for real-time classification, we adopt the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) for approximate k-NN. The LSH scheme is carefully designed to achieve high accuracy while being efficient for implementation on FPGA. Processing components in the architecture are optimized to realize high throughput. Extensive experiments and FPGA implementation results show that our design can achieve high accuracy above 99% for classifying three main categories of multimedia applications from Internet traffic while sustaining 80 Gbps throughput for minimum size (40 bytes) packets.","","","10.1109/FPL.2010.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5694221","traffic classification;multimedia application;k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN);locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)","Training;Accuracy;Field programmable gate arrays;Multimedia communication;Clocks;Testing;Throughput","field programmable gate arrays;Internet;pattern clustering;telecommunication traffic","multimedia traffic;FPGA;real-time classification;Internet traffic;network management;surveillance;deep packet inspection;machine learning;k-nearest neighbors;locality sensitive hashing","","19","32","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The former characterizes a scene using its global features, while the latter represents a scene by modeling its internal object configuration. Holistic strategy is good at representing scenes with simple contents, but it does not represent well complex scenes that consist of multiple objects. By contrast, semantic strategy is advantageous at recognizing scenes with complex objects, but it does not work well for simple scenes. In this paper, we propose to integrate holistic and semantic strategies to cope with scene classification. In particular, we exploit a deep learning algorithm to learn features for scene representation in the holistic way. For the semantic strategy, we explore a semantic spatial pyramid to represent the spatial object configuration of scenes. The holistic and semantic strategies are integrated using a method proposed by us.

The study examines the questions and statements that students and the facilitator generated as they traversed a complex conceptual space. The facilitator tended to use open-ended metacognitive questioning and never offered new ideas. His contributions built on the students thinking. These moves helped support deep student engagement with conceptual knowledge. Several specific strategies were identified that supported the goals of helping students construct causal explanations, reason effectively, and become self-directed learners. Studying facilitation in a face-to-face situation provides some guidance in designing support to use in an online problem-based learning environment; however, considerable adaptation is necessary as some facilitation can be built into the system but other facilitation may need to be done by a human tutor.

From a charging control standpoint the basic needs are a means for limiting recharge current and a means for avoiding damaging or unsafe high voltages. Furthermore, these functions must be built into the battery along with adequate controls to provide for fail-safe operation. Saft's experience has been that these charging needs can be met without problem in systems with standard telecom rectifier configurations. Inevitably, however, there are attempts to 'push the envelope,' taking Li-ion batteries designed for those standard systems and applying them with other charging sources and in other system configurations that do not conform to the norm. In some of these cases we have encountered incompatibilities and have had to work with the system integrator and/or adapt our control strategies accordingly. Examples include: systems with rectifiers in which software-controlled current limiting was implemented; ac power systems in which there was a high level of dc ripple; systems in which the charging source requires a minimum dc bus voltage in order to be energized; and deep-cycling systems requiring additional coordination of parallel string operation. This paper discusses some basic methods of Li-ion charging control and describes the lessons learned by Saft in nonstandard rectifier configurations. Typical communication, alarm management and control strategies are also discussed, including specific characteristics of Saft's latest Li-ion telecom products. Saft's position is that operators will not be properly served by these products unless communications and control are standardized in the industry and adopted by all rectifier and Liion battery manufacturers. Possible avenues for achieving this standardization are discussed.","","","10.1109/INTLEC.2010.5525704","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5525704","","Batteries;Rectifiers;Telecommunication control;Communication system control;Manufacturing;Telecommunication standards;Control systems;Temperature;Voltage control;Current limiters","battery chargers;battery management systems;power system control;safety systems;secondary cells;telecommunication power supplies","lithium ion battery charging;lithium ion battery control;standard telecom rectifier;fail safe operation;alarm management;control strategy","","","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, GNNs suffer, so as recurrent/recursive models, from the long-term dependency problem that makes the learning difficult in deep structures. In this paper, we present a new architecture, called Layered GNN (LGNN), realized by a cascade of GNNs: each layer is fed with the original data and with the state information calculated by the previous layer in the cascade. Intuitively, this allows each GNN to solve a subproblem, related only to those patterns that were misclassified by the previous GNNs.

In stochastic pooling, a distribution is produced for each pooling region by the softmax normalization of the piece values. The active piece is selected based on the distribution during training, and an effective probability weighting is conducted during testing. We apply the stochastic pooling maxout (SPM) networks within the DNN-HMM framework and evaluate its effectiveness under a low-resource speech recognition condition. On benchmark test sets, the SPM network yields 4.7-8.6% relative improvements over the baseline maxout network.

This is partly due to the broad range of human activities as well as the rich variation in how a given activity can be performed. Using features that clearly separate between activities is crucial.

A typical FPSO vessel may produce up to 300,000 barrels of oil per day (BOPD) and 300 million standard cubic feet of gas per day (SCFGPD), with one million barrels of on board oil storage. Oil off loading is normally by shuttle tanker and associated gas is normally injected to maintain field pressure. These vessels typically have more extensive electrical systems than the typical fixed platforms. Electrical loads may total 40-50 MW or more depending on the vessel configuration. Selection of the large drivers (turbines versus motors), picking the generation configuration (including prime, essential and emergency), configuring the electrical distribution system, and locating the various parts of the electrical distribution system (hull versus topsides) are major critical early decisions that will impact the future coordination efforts of the project.

Interdisciplinarity in the research field involves the application of several methodological approaches towards analysis of CSCL that range from deep-level qualitative analyses of small interaction-rich episodes of collaboration, to quantitative measures of suitably categorized events of interaction that are used as indicators of the success of collaboration in some of its facets. This article adopts an alternative approach to CSCL analysis that aims at taking advantage of some desired properties of each of these diverse methodological trends, involving the use of a rating scheme for the assessment of collaboration quality. After defining a set of dimensions that cover the most important aspects of collaboration, it employs appropriately trained human agents to assign ratings of collaboration quality to each dimension, basing their assessments on substantial aspects of collaboration that are not easily formalisable. The activities studied here regard 228 collaborating dyads, working synchronously on a computer science problem-solving task with the use of the Synergo tool. Based on this large dataset, relations between dimensions of collaboration quality are unraveled on empirical grounds, based on the ratings of collaboration quality that were elaborated statistically using a multidimensional scaling technique. Results obtained are in accordance with the initial design of the rating scheme used, and further particularize the relations between the dimensions it defines.","","","10.1109/INCOS.2010.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5702080","computer supported collaborative learning;multidimensional scaling;rating scheme;synchronous collaborative problem-solving","Collaboration;Reliability;Correlation;Algorithm design and analysis;Problem-solving;Computer science;Information processing","computer aided instruction;computer science education;groupware;problem solving","collaboration quality;computer supported collaborative learning;intelligent networking technology;collaborative systems technology;human agents;computer science problem-solving;Synergo tool;multidimensional scaling technique","","","39","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Indeed, the evolution of approaches for traffic classification can be associated with the evolution of the Internet itself and with the adoption of new services and the emergence of novel applications and communication paradigms. Throughout the years many approaches have been proposed for addressing technical issues imposed by such novel services. Deep-Packet Inspection (DPI) has been a very important research topic within the traffic classification field and its concept consists of the analysis of the contents of the captured packets in order to accurately and timely discriminate the traffic generated by different Internet protocols. DPI was devised as a means to address several issues associated with port-based and statistical-based classification approaches in order to achieve an accurate and timely traffic classification. Many research works proposed different DPI schemes while many open-source modules have also become available for deployment. Surveys become then valuable tools for performing an overall analysis, study and comparison between the several proposed methods. In this paper we present a survey in which a complete and thorough analysis of the most important open-source DPI modules is performed. Such analysis comprises an evaluation of the classification accuracy, through a common set of traffic traces with ground truth, and of the computational requirements. In this manner, this survey presents a technical assessment of DPI modules and the analysis of the obtained evaluation results enable the proposal of general guidelines for the design and implementation of more adequate DPI modules.","","","10.1109/SURV.2013.100613.00161","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644335","Internet traffic identification;Performance evaluation;Open source software","Internet;Protocols;Ports (Computers);Algorithm design and analysis;Accuracy;Vectors;Machine learning algorithms","Internet;pattern classification;telecommunication traffic","payload-based traffic classification approach;Internet traffic classification;deep-packet inspection;Internet protocols;statistical-based classification approach;port-based classification approach;DPI schemes;open-source DPI modules","","50","71","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We show that training data can be reduced significantly, and that our technique outperforms both random selection and a previously proposed selection method utilizing comparable resources.

Our aim was to evaluate cardiorespiratory and movement signals in discriminating between wake, rapid-eye-movement (REM), light (N1N2), and deep (N3) sleep. The dataset comprised 85 nights of PSG from a healthy population. Starting from a total of 750 characteristic variables (features), problem-specific subsets of 40 features were forwardly selected using the combination of a wrapper method (Cohen's kappa statistic on radial basis function (RBF)-kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier) and filter method (minimum redundancy maximum relevance criterion on mutual information). Final classification was performed using an RBF-kernel SVM.

The proposed model defines contextual state transitions from the joint configuration of the children to the parent nodes. We argue that the bottom-up context postulates different probabilistic assumptions with respect to a top-down approach, leading to different representational capabilities. We discuss classes of applications that are best suited to a bottom-up approach. In particular, the bottom-up context is shown to better correlate and model the co-occurrence of substructures among the child subtrees of internal nodes. A mixed memory approximation is introduced to factorize the joint children-to-parent state transition matrix as a mixture of pairwise transitions. The proposed approach is the first practical bottom-up generative model for tree-structured data that maintains the same computational class of its top-down counterpart. Comparative experimental analyses exploiting synthetic and real-world datasets show that the proposed model can deal with deep structures better than a top-down generative model. The model is also shown to better capture structural information from real-world data comprising trees with a large out-degree. The proposed bottom-up model can be used as a fundamental building block for the development of other new powerful models.","","","10.1109/TNNLS.2012.2222044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353263","Bottom-up processing;hidden recursive model;hidden tree Markov model;tree-structured data","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Approximation methods;Tree data structures;Data models;Probabilistic logic","approximation theory;directed graphs;matrix algebra;tree data structures","compositional generative mapping;bottom-up probabilistic modeling;compositional probabilistic model;approximated bottom-up generative process;contextual state transitions;probabilistic assumptions;child subtrees;internal nodes;mixed memory approximation;joint children-to-parent state transition matrix;practical bottom-up generative model;tree-structured data;top-down generative model;real-world datasets;tree out-degree","Decision Trees;Humans;Markov Chains;Models, Statistical;Pattern Recognition, Automated","20","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, in a traditional exam it is difficult to assess if professional skills have been acquired in depth. In this paper we propose to substitute the traditional exam by a take-home exam in which students have more time to solve the questions and are not restricted by the sources they can consult, thereby providing a highly educational task in which students experience a deep learning process. We also analyze what kind of questions should be asked to evaluate professional skills, as well as analyzing the potential drawbacks of these kind of exams (such as inappropriate student behavior).

"Imaging neuroscience: Lessons from studies of brain plasticity","R. S. J. Frackowiak","Inst. of Neurology, Univ. Coll. London, UK","5th IEEE EMBS International Summer School on Biomedical Imaging, 2002.","","2002","","","14 pp.","","The non-invasive brain scanning techniques, introduced a quarter of a century ago, have become crucial for diagnosis in clinical neurology. They have also been used to investigate brain function and have provided information about normal activity and pathogenesis. They have been used to investigate functional specialisation in the brain and how specialised areas communicate to generate complex integrated functions such as speech, memory, the emotions and so on. The phenomenon of brain plasticity is poorly understood, and yet clinical neurologists are aware, from everyday observations, that spontaneous recovery from brain lesions is common. An improved understanding of the mechanisms of recovery may generate new therapeutic strategies and indicate ways of modulating mechanisms that promote plastic compensation for loss of function. The main methods used to investigate these issues are positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI is also used to map brain structure. The techniques of functional brain mapping and computational morphometrics depend on high performance scanners and a validated set of analytic statistical procedures that generate reproducible data and meaningful inferences from brain scanning data. The motor system presents a good paradigm to illustrate advances made by scanning towards an understanding of plasticity at the level of brain areas. The normal motor system is organised in a nested hierarchy. Recovery from paralysis caused by internal capsule strokes involves functional reorganisation manifesting as changed patterns of activity in the component brain areas of the normal motor system. The pattern of plastic modification depends in part on patterns of residual or disturbed connectivity after brain injury. Therapeutic manipulations in patients with Parkinson's disease using deep brain stimulation, dopaminergic agents or foetal mesencephalic transplantation provide a means to examine mechanisms underpinning plastic change. Other models of plastic change, such as normal visuospatial learning or re-establishing speech comprehension after cochlear implantation in the deaf illustrate how patterns of brain function adapt over time. Limitations of the scanning techniques and prospects for the future are discussed in relation to new developments in the neuroimaging field.","","","10.1109/SSBI.2002.1233970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1233970","","Neuroscience;Neuroplasticity;Plastics;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain;Speech;Nervous system;Pathogens;Lesions;Positron emission tomography","neurophysiology;brain;positron emission tomography;biomedical MRI;patient diagnosis;diseases;patient treatment;prosthetics;vision;speech;handicapped aids","imaging neuroscience;brain plasticity;noninvasive brain scanning;clinical diagnosis;clinical neurology;brain function;pathogenesis;complex integrated functions;brain lesions;plastic compensation;positron emission tomography;magnetic resonance imaging;brain structure mapping;computational morphometrics;analytic statistical procedures;brain scanning data;motor system;normal motor system;paralysis;internal capsule strokes;functional reorganisation;plastic modification;disturbed connectivity;brain injury;therapeutic manipulations;Parkinson disease;deep brain stimulation;dopaminergic agents;foetal mesencephalic transplantation;normal visuospatial learning;speech comprehension;neuroimaging","","","63","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The new method for segmentation and interpretation of deep neuroanatomic structures such as thalamus, putamen, ventricular system, etc. incorporates a priori knowledge about shapes of the neuroanatomic structures to provide their robust segmentation and labeling in magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. The method was trained in eight MR brain images and tested in 19 brain images by comparison to observer-defined independent standards. Neuroanatomic structures in all testing images were successfully identified. Computer-identified and observer-defined neuroanatomic structures agreed well. The average labeling error was 7%/spl plusmn/3%. Border positioning errors were quite small, with the average border positioning error of 0.8/spl plusmn/0.1 pixels in 256/spl times/256 MR images.

Against this background the adaptation of the QFD technique focused mainly on exploring the measurements of software behavior (or, performance characteristics) and on assuring the degree of completeness (or appropriateness) of high-level specifications, while facilitating the analysis and design activities of the product-development team.

Copper's high reflectivity at the 1 μm wavelengths has always been the barrier in the past to implement laser welding. Frequency doubled green lasers can remove this barrier and has a high potential to revolutionize the laser welding of copper materials in high volumes and for future applications. In this paper, we present new results for welding copper and copper alloys with a novel brilliant laser, emitting in the green wavelength region (up to 325 W@515 nm, 2 mm mrad).

Fundamental investigations on the absorption and energy coupling properties in the different phases of the process (heating up, heat conduction welding, deep penetration welding) were performed to learn more about process stability and process reproducibility of the welding process at copper alloys.

The fact that such software controls virtually all flight activities, and that failures attributed to software often have roots in systems engineering, has led to recognition of the need for a closer coupling between systems engineering and software engineering. Because of this, there has been an increasing amount of work devoted to developing new approaches to systems engineering for model-based control and operations system design. One such approach is state analysis. State analysis is a structured methodology for analysis of control problems that emphasizes state variables and behavior models. It strives to unify systems and software engineering disciplines into a common set of vocabulary, procedures, and tools, utilizing common framework software to achieve a very direct realization of analysis artifacts into code. This paper examines the practical application of state analysis by following the full development cycle of a prototype monitor and control system targeting NASA's proposed array-based deep space network (DSN), from initial state analysis through goal-based operations design, translation of systems engineering specifications into a software design, and finally implementation of the design through the adaptation of the software framework. The synergy between systems and software engineering is highlighted through concrete examples of reusable software design patterns that map directly to systems engineering artifacts, including mechanisms for goal-based fault tolerance.

As the volume of biomolecular reports has increased, there has been a great deal of research on text mining to detect protein subcellular localization information in documents. It has been argued that linguistic information, especially syntactic information, is useful for identifying the subcellular localizations of proteins of interest. However, previous systems for detecting protein subcellular localization information used only shallow syntactic parsers, and showed poor performance. Thus, there remains a need to use a full syntactic parser and to apply deep linguistic knowledge to the analysis of text for protein subcellular localization information. In addition, we have attempted to use semantic information from the WordNet thesaurus. To improve performance in detecting protein subcellular localization information, this paper proposes a three-step method based on a full syntactic dependency parser and semantic information. In the first step, we construct syntactic dependency paths from each protein to its location candidate. In the second step, we retrieve root information of the syntactic dependency paths. In the final step, we extract syn-semantic patterns of protein subtrees and location subtrees. From the root and subtree nodes, we extract syntactic category and syntactic direction as syntactic information, and synset offset of the WordNet thesaurus as semantic information. According to the root information and syn-semantic patterns of subtrees, we extract (protein, localization) pairs. Even with no biomolecular knowledge, our method shows reasonable performance in experimental results using Medline abstract data. In fact, our proposed method gave an F-measure of 74.53% for training data and 58.90% for test data, significantly outperforming previous methods, by 12-25%.","","","10.1109/FSKD.2008.529","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4666419","","Data mining;Protein engineering;Text mining;Information analysis;Thesauri;Information retrieval;Testing;Bioinformatics;Learning systems;Fuzzy systems","biology computing;data mining;grammars;proteins","protein subcellular localization;syntactic parser;semantic information;text mining;WordNet thesaurus;syntactic dependency path","","1","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whereas pattern application is usually more efficient, tree kernels can be superior when assessed by the F-measure. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach to extracting meronymy relations, which is based on both patterns and kernel functions. In a first step, meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from a text corpus by applying patterns. In a second step these relation hypotheses are validated by using several shallow features and a graph kernel approach. In contrast to other meronymy extraction and validation methods which are based on surface or syntactic representations we use a purely semantic approach based on semantic networks. This involves analyzing each sentence of the Wikipedia corpus by a deep syntactico-semantic parser and converting it into a semantic network. Meronymy relation hypotheses are extracted from the semantic networks by means of an automated theorem prover, which employs a set of logical axioms and patterns in the form of semantic networks. The meronymy candidates are then validated by means of a graph kernel approach based on common walks. The evaluation shows that this method achieves considerably higher accuracy, recall, and F-measure than a method using purely shallow validation.","","","10.1109/ICMLA.2010.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5708840","graph kernel;support vector machine;meronyms;patterns;logic","Kernel;Semantics;Support vector machines;Feature extraction;Tin;Internet;Encyclopedias","linguistics;pattern matching;support vector machines;theorem proving;trees (mathematics)","meronymy hypotheses;support vector machines;graph kernels;pattern matching;tree kernel functions;syntactic structures;F-measure;Wikipedia corpus;syntactico-semantic parser;automated theorem prover","","1","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Local spatial-temporal (ST) features are widely adopted in many works. However, most existing works which represent action video by histogram of ST words fail to have a deep insight into a fine structure of actions because of the local nature of these features. In this paper, we propose a novel method to simultaneously localize and recognize action units (AU) by regarding them as 3D (x,y,t) objects. Firstly, we record all of the local ST features in a codebook with the information of action class labels and relative positions to the respective AU centers. This simulates the probability distribution of class label and relative position in a non-parameter manner. When a novel video comes, we match its ST features to the codebook entries and cast votes for positions of its AU centers. And we utilize the localization result to recognize these AUs. The presented experiments on a public dataset demonstrate that our method performs well.","","","10.1109/ICME.2009.5202573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5202573","human action;action unit;recognition","Humans;Gold;Histograms;Object recognition;Robustness;Image recognition;Laboratories;Computers;Image sequences;Learning systems","computer vision;image recognition;image representation;probability","action unit recognition;action localization;human behavior analysis;local spatial-temporal features;action video representation;histogram;codebook;probability distribution;computer vision;multimedia analysis","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, such approaches may lead to suboptimal models especially when the number of training images is small. In this paper, we propose incorporating existing domain knowledge resources into knowledge discovery. More specifically, we have developed methods for using ontological relationships between geospatial semantics to oversample under-represented semantics. Our experimental results show that our technique improves the knowledge discovery process, as evidenced by increased precision of semantic queries.","","","10.1109/IGARSS.2008.4779394","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4779394","","Ontologies;Satellites;Image databases;Data mining;Association rules;Partitioning algorithms;Training data;Computer science;Optimization methods;Supervised learning","data mining;geophysical signal processing;image retrieval;ontologies (artificial intelligence);remote sensing;visual databases","ontology driven content mining;semantic queries;satellite image databases;geospatial domain knowledge discovery;content-based image retrieval;geospatial semantics","","1","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One of MAVEN's unique circumstances is the fact that it is a Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) flight project. Despite being an international leader in Earth and Space Science Missions, and providing instruments for planetary missions, GSFC has not had the project office in the development of planetary missions. Until the selection of MAVEN as NASA's second Mars Scout, the GSFC Flight Projects Directorate had not had full management responsibility for the development of an entire Mars mission. This paper will focus on the dovetailing of the Spacecraft (SIC) Team's and GSFC's approach to Requirements Management, Verification & Validation, (V&V) and the Ground and Operations test programs. As the MAVEN development progressed, the GSFCbased MAVEN project Mission Operations and Ground Data System (MOS/GDS) team quickly realized that a different paradigm was needed. GSFC's approach used on Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) Earth Science missions, GSFC's predominant background and experience, did not lend itself to the MAVEN mission. Instead, the SIC team brought the planetary mission approach to the project as the subject matter experts for Mars missions. From their previous experience on Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), and the Jovian Juno mission, heritage runs deep on MAVEN. Heritage provides a simplified and cost-effective approach, but not without its pitfalls. Early feedback from the review cycle highlighted the need to collaborate on the implementation. Synergy was needed between GSFC standards, GOLD Rules, NASA standards and expectations, and the established planetary mission heritage, experience and processes. The MAVEN project needed to find a new model. Through collaboration, the MOSIGDS Team and the Spacecraft (SIC) Team adapted resources to work within the heritage framework while addressing the new expectations. The project level V & V plan was reworked, the test program modified, and the processes updated to meet the project needs.","","","10.1109/AERO.2014.6836518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6836518","","NASA;Mars;Sun;Lead;Observatories;Extraterrestrial measurements;Magnetic resonance imaging","Mars;planetary atmospheres;solar wind;space vehicles","GSFC flight project;MAVEN mission;Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN Mission;AD 2013 11 18;planetary upper atmosphere;planetary ionosphere;solar wind;Goddard Space Flight Center;spacecraft team dovetailing;Mission Operations System;Ground Data System;Mars mission subject matter experts;Mars Odyssey;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter;Jovian Juno mission;NASA standards;GOLD rules","","","1","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automation is partly to be blamed for this problem. In fact, the existence of the “auto scale” button has eliminated the hassle of making adjustments, but at the price of dampening the students' curiosity and removing their need for deep understanding. We have found a powerful way of stimulating students' curiosity and of bestowing them with knowledge of the basic oscilloscope operation: While still using an oscilloscope-set, although merely as a display unit, we have by-passed its fundamental components (namely the vertical amplifier, the time base and the trigger circuit), with our own designed components, built outside of the oscilloscope-set. Our teaching strategy provides students with hands-on experimentation of the circuits that control vertical gain, the time scale and the trigger level. Our educational tool is implemented in hardware; it is not another simulation oscilloscope. The effects of our didactic tool are highly positive, as demonstrated by student evaluation of circuit laboratories that took place before and after we incorporated the Educational Oscilloscope into the engineering curriculum.

Reductions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon- neutral. Over the next several centuries most or all of the earth's fossil fuel reserves (about 4000 Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while control of global warming is of immediate concern, possibilities of other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in an interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global warming. If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper, earth-based and space- based techniques are explored that are designed to supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, but also to changing conditions in the earth system, such as the net incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are intended to perturb the earth's energy balance in a controllable manner. Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium energy state. About 1.0 W/m2 more energy is coming into the earth than is leaving, indicating that the earth is ""committed"" to this amount of global warming and its attendant consequences, even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmospheredo not continue to increase. This energy imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5degC to 1degC, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation techniques would be to help ""uncommit"" earth from such energy imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate change.","","","10.1109/EICCCC.2006.277274","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4057303","climate change mitigation;global warming;global cooling;geoengineering","Earth;Global warming;Carbon dioxide;Carbon capture and storage;Cooling;Aerosols;Temperature control;Atmosphere;Energy capture;Power generation","air pollution control;energy storage;global warming;greenhouses;renewable energy sources;risk analysis","alternative earth-based techniques;space-based techniques;global climate change mitigation;greenhouse gases emissions reduction;coal fired power plants;energy efficiency;renewable energy sources;earth fossil fuel;equilibrium energy state;Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change","","4","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, students' perceptions of these models are sometimes incorrect. In organic synthesis students should comprehend information about reactions and, simultaneously, visualize the inverse of these reactions. Without deep understanding of the mechanistic aspects of organic reactions, students will face problems in an advanced chemistry course. Another problem in teaching organic chemistry effectively is the wide range of abilities and academic interests of students. The introductory organic chemistry class caters for students from various science and technology fields. Based on this context, a computer application was used as an alternative approach for teaching and learning organic chemistry with the assumption that animations could assist students to better understand concepts. In a study by Gilbert, Reiner and Nakhleh (2008), it was implied that animated presentations could exert an extra cognitive load on students. Consequently, a relevant question that educators need to answer is “How visuals should be animated in science instruction?” This study examined how an animation based computer application that applied an electron-moving technique was used as a supplementary material in a first year Organic Chemistry course and its effect on the performance of students. Using pre and post-test design, the study involved a comparison between an experimental group of first year students (n=28) who followed instructions that used moving-electron technique in a blended mode and a conventional group of first year students (n=27) who used arrow-pushing technique to learn the fundamental concept of organic reaction mechanism. The finding suggest the potential of using electron-moving technique as an instructional approach based on the improved post-test performance as compared to arrow-pushing techniques.","","","10.1109/ITHET.2014.7155719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155719","organic chemistry;animation;arrow pushing technique;electron moving technique","Education;Animation;Visualization;Computer applications;Computers;Chemicals","chemical reactions;chemistry computing;computer animation;courseware;educational courses;organic compounds;teaching","SEA application;arrow-pushing technique;electron-moving technique;macroscopic level of thought;submicroscopic level of thought;symbolic level of thought;student perception;organic synthesis;advanced chemistry course;organic chemistry teaching;introductory organic chemistry class;organic chemistry learning;concept understanding;animated presentation;cognitive load;science instruction;animation based computer application;Organic Chemistry course;student performance;blended mode;organic reaction mechanism;instructional approach;animated courseware","","","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bissiri","Canadian Research Chair - Robotics and Automation, School of Engineering, Laurentian University, Chief Technology Officer, Penguin Automated Systems Inc.; Research Associate, Penguin Automated Systems Inc.","OCEANS 2007","","2007","","","1","9","Mining, construction, aquaculture and many other possible uses of the planet's underwater resources will be necessary in the future. Much of our current mineral wealth on the land mass of the planet is becoming depleted. We must turn to the oceans to provide the resources we will require in the future. Presently, we are mining 29% of the planet's surface area deeper and deeper while the 71% which is underwater is basically untouched. As mining underwater is inevitable we must ensure that environmentally we are more responsible than miners have been perceived to be. We have much to learn about our underwater environment. In some cases nature has managed to do what we have not been able to do in our current mining operations. Tube worms have the ability to chemically convert the waste products of volcanics safely into the natural environment. Miners have dreamed about these types of biological solutions to processing waste products. To explore and consider mining in the deep ocean a few basic facts must be considered. Prolonged work in the underwater environment by people will only be done robotically and the need for human intervention is going to be required. This leads to the need to create new mining systems that support multiple machine situations where untethered units can be operated both autonomously and tele-autonomously. Underwater mining in deep ocean environments will require multiple robots of different types to be deployed. This approach while in a different environment is similar to leading edge work already underway in underground mining by the major mining companies. Mining machines thousands of metres below the surface are controlled tele-robotically from surface control rooms. The combination of sophisticated high bandwidth communication, specialized control systems and on-board standard electronics have allowed teleautonomous machines to be utilized into the mining of ore at great depths underground. These tele- robotic techniques have proven successful in underground operations and are currently being considered for open pit mining operations. Underwater conditions while very different from underground conditions for mining are similar when considering the mining robots to be deployed. Where underground rock considerations are rock temperature, pressure, strength and fractures, underwater has similar issues to deal with but the medium changes to a homogenous liquid. This fact from a mining engineer's point-of-view makes water an ideal environment to work in. Moreover, the robotics challenge is easier to deal with as long as teleautonomous techniques can be utilized. Since the needs are nearly identical the solutions should be similar. So how will the underwater mine of the future look from a mining perspective? Mining of the ocean's bottom will likely be done using open pit mining techniques to begin with possibly harvesting mineral rich""black smokers"", ultimately leading to underground ocean bed mines if the mineral can support economic development and operation. Environmental considerations will be of prime importance as they currently are to the Canadian mining industry. Operations of this style of mining will see tele-robotic control with solid- state underwater robots as an imperative step. While many functions can be done autonomously the most complex tasks will require human intervention. Current teleautonomous submarine operation done using umbilical cables would be nearly impossible as mining operations would require operating multiple machines. The main robotic constraint would be umbilical management in a multiple machine mining operation. This situation is not suitable for large scale underwater mining operations. This paper reports on the research and development of a new high bandwidth optical networking and communication system to enable untethered operation of tele-robotic submarines and ultimately future underwater mining equipment. The key concept for the development of underwater mining tele-robotics has been the development a new Free Space Optical (FSO) communication network solution to support wireless underwater video and high capacity data streaming from multiple underwater machines to a surface control vessel. This paper reports on considerations for deep ocean mining and the establishment of major robotic mining operations in the oceans.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.2007.4449121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4449121","","Bandwidth;Optical fiber networks;Telerobotics;Robots;Minerals;Sea surface;Ocean temperature;Communication system control;Planets;Humans","data communication;marine communication;marine engineering;mining;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;radio access networks;telerobotics;underwater equipment","underwater resources;mineral wealth;deep ocean mining;underwater mining system;telerobotic mining;teleautonomous machine;underground rock;telerobotic control;teleautonomous submarine operation;umbilical cable;high bandwidth optical networking;free space optical communication network;FSO communication network;wireless underwater video;wireless data transmission;data streaming","","12","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unsupervised expectation-maximization (EM) clustering is used over data obtained from 244 all-night polysomnographic sleep studies, revealing several naturally occurring sleep type clusters. It is found that sleep efficiency plays a major role in differentiating among sleep types, with time in deep sleep further refining the sleep type classification. Associations are found between sleep type on the one hand, and variables that describe health history and habits on the other. These findings suggest that the discovered sleep types describe medically meaningful groups of sleep behaviors that may be useful in future sleep research.","","","10.1109/CBMS.2010.6042695","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6042695","","Sleep;Switching circuits;Humans;Heart;History;Indexes;Electroencephalography","expectation-maximisation algorithm;medical computing;pattern classification;sleep;unsupervised learning","sleep composition types;coarse classification;unsupervised expectation-maximization clustering;sleep type classification;sleep behaviors","","3","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike other variants of auto-encoders, contrastive auto-encoder is able to leverage class labels in constructing its representation layer. We achieve this by modeling two autoencoders together and making their differences contribute to the total loss function. The transformation built with contrastive auto-encoder can be seen as a task-specific and invariant feature learner. Our experiments on TIMIT clearly show the superiority of the feature extracted from contrastive auto-encoder over original acoustic feature, feature extracted from deep auto-encoder, and feature extracted from a model that contrastive auto-encoder originates from.","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854056","auto-encoder;contrastive auto-encoder;phoneme recognition;deep neural network (DNN);restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM)","Feature extraction;Training;Hidden Markov models;Neurons;DNA;Data models;Acoustics","feature extraction;speech processing;speech recognition","phoneme recognition;contrastive auto-encoder;speech data;task irrelevant information;phonetic information;speaker characteristic information;emotional information;representation layer;task-specific learner;invariant feature learner;feature extraction;acoustic feature","","3","15","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Inspired by the observation that pose variations change non-linearly but smoothly, we propose to learn pose-robust features by modeling the complex non-linear transform from the non-frontal face images to frontal ones through a deep network in a progressive way, termed as stacked progressive auto-encoders (SPAE). Specifically, each shallow progressive auto-encoder of the stacked network is designed to map the face images at large poses to a virtual view at smaller ones, and meanwhile keep those images already at smaller poses unchanged. Then, stacking multiple these shallow auto-encoders can convert non-frontal face images to frontal ones progressively, which means the pose variations are narrowed down to zero step by step. As a result, the outputs of the topmost hidden layers of the stacked network contain very small pose variations, which can be used as the pose-robust features for face recognition. An additional attractiveness of the proposed method is that no pose estimation is needed for the test images. The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets with pose variations, i.e., MultiPIE and FERET datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method to the existing works, especially to those 2D ones.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2014.243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6909639","Stacked Progressive Auto-Encoders;Deep network;face recognition across pose","Face;Three-dimensional displays;Transforms;Face recognition;Solid modeling;Decoding;Training","face recognition;image coding;transforms","stacked progressive autoencoders;SPAE;face recognition;pose variations;pose-robust features;complex nonlinear transform;nonfrontal face images;MultiPIE datasets;FERET datasets","","99","28","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is about only a single domain - sensory domain X. During development from conception through fetus and newborn, every brain neuron has three major domains of input, sensory X, lateral Y and motor Z. The single-domain model of WWN-6 is not directly applicable to multiple domains because different domains have very different dimension and signal variations that cannot be directly compared. We believe that cross-domain synaptic maintenance is a crucial mechanism to develop a shallow-and-deep processing hierarchy in the brain where each neuron autonomously select domains in the developing hierarchy, not necessarily directly connected to receptors in X and muscles in Z. In the new work here, we propose a biologically inspired model for cross-domain synaptic maintenance. We assume that the earlier connection guided by morphogen result in initial coarse connection, but cross-domain synaptic maintenance refine connections to enable each neuron to autonomously find its role. As concept patterns emerge in Z, neurons refine their connections, to differentiate their roles among sensory processing, motor processing, and a mixture of both. Experimentally, we show the effect of the new theory through learning of individual objects and object groups, where neurons initialized for object-group connections tend to find their receptor inputs from X are not as stable as inputs from motor Z, thus, gradually turn into ""later"" processing neurons - for ""higher-level"" object-based features and their invariances. In principle, WWN-9 tends to learn a new object group without repeating the learning of all instances of each individual object.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2014.6889960","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6889960","","Neurons;Maintenance engineering;Vectors;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Joining processes;Biological system modeling","feature extraction;neural nets;object recognition","WWN-9;cross-domain synaptic maintenance;object groups recognition;where what network 6;WWN-6;neural transmitters;acetylcholine;norepinephrine;sensory domain;shallow-and-deep processing hierarchy;sensory processing;motor processing;object-group connections;object-based features","","4","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has recently advanced the state-of-the-art in image classification dramatically AlexNet and has consequently attracted a lot of interest within the computer vision community. Although the classification task is quite different from the retrieval task we consider, there is an obvious hope to improve the performance of deep feature by adapting them to the task, and such adaptation is the subject of the image retrieval task. Inspired by the robust ConvNet, we focus on providing a quantitative evaluation of the image retrieval performance of the features that learned from the convolutional neural network trained for image classification. First, a simple multi-stage convolutional neural network had been constructed for parameter adjustment. When different architectures are compared, an optimal architecture for feature extraction can be used to provide activation value to be mapped to binary codes as ConvNet codes for retrieval task. Then we evaluate the performance of the compressed ConvNet codes and show that a simple PCA compression provides short codes (e.g. 16bits ConvNet codes) that give best accuracy on MNIST benchmark dataset.

Data Compression Conference","","1997","","","3","11","Data compression and learning are, in some sense, two sides of the same coin. If we paraphrase Occam's razor by saying that a small theory is better than a larger theory with the same explanatory power, we can characterize data compression as a preoccupation with small, and learning as a preoccupation with better. Nevill-Manning et al. (see Proc. Data Compression Conference, Los Alamitos, CA, p.244-253, 1994) presented an algorithm, since dubbed SEQUITUR, that presents both faces of the compression/learning coin. Its performance as a data compression scheme outstrips other dictionary schemes, and the structures that it learns from sequences as diverse as DNA and music are intuitively compelling. We present three new results that characterize SEQUITUR's computational and compression performance. First, we prove that SEQUITUR operates in time linear in n, the length of the input sequence, despite its ability to build a hierarchy as deep as log(n). Second, we show that a sequence can be compressed incrementally, improving on the non-incremental algorithm that was described by Nevill-Manning et al., and making on-line compression feasible. Third, we present an intriguing result that emerged during benchmarking; whereas PPMC outperforms SEQUITUR on most files in the Calgary corpus, SEQUITUR regains the lead when tested on multimegabyte sequences. We make some tentative conclusions about the underlying reasons for this phenomenon, and about the nature of current compression benchmarking.","","","10.1109/DCC.1997.581951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=581951","","Sequences;Data compression;Benchmark testing;Biochemistry;Computer science;Dictionaries;DNA;Pursuit algorithms;Character generation","data compression;inference mechanisms;grammars;sequences","linear-time incremental hierarchy inference;data compression;learning;SEQUITUR algorithm;dictionary schemes;compression performance;computational performance;input sequence length;nonincremental algorithm;online compression;grammar;Calgary corpus;multimegabyte sequences;compression benchmarking","","34","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Students benefit from plenty of opportunity and encouragement to express their understanding, and from informed, supportive, possibly challenging, feedback. At the same time, we observe that many students at our university do not find that they receive helpful feedback. One in three engineering students disagree or strongly disagree with the quality of teaching questionnaire's ""I received helpful feedback on how I was going"" in the individual course, and most other disciplines find themselves in a similar situation. For the university as a whole, student responses to this question are clearly less positive than to other questions on quality of teaching, intellectual stimulation, staff interest, workload, and so on, and this state of affairs seems quite common in the Australian context. We discuss best practice in feedback provision, partly based on our interviews with students and staff. We have been particularly interested in identifying cost-effective ways of providing informed and constructive feedback to large classes. Feedback is often understood, by engineering students and staff alike, simply as comments on submitted work typically written assignments. We argue in favour of a broader concept that covers a multitude of ways for a student to develop deep learning through conversation, including questions and answers provided by others, team work, study groups, and formative teacher-provided feedback during an assessment task. We emphasize the coaching role of the teacher, and feedback designed to encourage students to monitor own learning. Large classes pose particular logistic problems. We identify staff development as a crucial factor for consistent, effective feedback, and point to web-based feedback provision as a workable solution to some logistic problems. We briefly discuss the role of information technology more broadly, both for learning enhancement and for automated feedback provision.","","","10.1109/FIE.2004.1408573","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1408573","","Education;Australia;Engineering students;Best practices;Logistics;Computer science;Monitoring;Information technology;State feedback","engineering education;teaching;student experiments","educational experts;engineering students;teaching quality;intellectual stimulation;staff interest;workload;Australian context;feedback provision;conversation learning;logistic problems;web-based feedback provision;information technology;automated feedback provision;formative assessment;large class teaching","","4","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Speech enhancement methods, e. g., using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), are succesful in improving the robustness of ASR systems. Furthermore, discriminative training and feature transformations are employed to increase the robustness of traditional systems using Gaussian mixture models (GMM). On the other hand, acoustic models based on deep neural networks (DNN) were recently shown to outperform GMMs. In this work, we combine a state-of-the art GMM system with a deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network in a double-stream architecture. Such networks use memory cells in the hidden units, enabling them to learn long-range temporal context, and thus increasing the robustness against noise and reverberation. The network is trained to predict frame-wise phoneme estimates, which are converted into observation likelihoods to be used as an acoustic model. It is of particular interest whether the LSTM system is capable of improving a robust state-of-the-art GMM system, which is confirmed in the experimental results. In addition, we investigate the efficiency of NMF for speech enhancement on the front-end side. Experiments are conducted on the medium-vocabulary task of the 2nd `CHiME' Speech Separation and Recognition Challenge, which includes reverberation and highly variable noise. Experimental results show that the average word error rate of the challenge baseline is reduced by 64% relative. The best challenge entry, a noise-robust state-of-the-art recognition system, is outperformed by 25% relative.","","","10.1109/TASLP.2014.2318514","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6802435","Long short-term memory;multi-stream recognition;noise robust speech recognition;non-negative matrix factorization","Hidden Markov models;Speech;Training;Noise;Acoustics;Speech enhancement;Noise measurement","Gaussian processes;matrix algebra;recurrent neural nets;speech recognition","memory enhanced neural networks;NMF;robust ASR;speech recognition;reverberant noisy environments;speech enhancement methods;nonnegative matrix factorization;discriminative training;feature transformations;Gaussian mixture models;GMM;acoustic models;deep neural networks;DNN;long short term memory;LSTM recurrent neural network;double stream architecture;memory cells;hidden units;phoneme estimation;acoustic model;CHiME speech separation","","12","44","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This reaction is extremely important to the study of Ocean Acidification (OA) and is the critical technical driver in the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's (MBARI) Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) experiments. The deep water FOCE science experiments are conducted at depths beyond scuba diver reach and demand that a valid perturbation experiment operate at a stable yet naturally fluctuating lower pH condition and avoid large or rapid pH variation as well as incomplete reactions, when we expose an experimental region or sample. Therefore, the technical requirement is to create a CO2 source in situ that is stable and well controlled. After extensive research and experimentation MBARI has developed the ability to create an in situ source of CO2 enriched seawater (ESW) for distribution and subsequent use in an ocean acidification experiment. The system mates with FOCE, but can be used in conjunction with other CO2 experimental applications in deep water. The ESW system is completely standalone from FOCE. While the chemical changes induced by the addition of fossil fuel CO2 on the ocean are well known and easily predicted, the biological consequences are less clear and the subject of considerable debate. Experiments have been successfully carried out on land to investigate the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels in various areas around the globe but only limited work on CO2 impacts to ocean environmental systems have been carried out to date. With rising concern over the long-term reduction in ocean pH, there is a need for viable in situ techniques to carry out experiments on marine biological systems. Previous investigations have used aquaria that compromise these studies because of reduced ecological complexity and buffering capacity. Additionally, aquaria use tightly controlled experimental conditions such as temperature, artificial light, and water quality that do not represent the natural ocean variability. In order to study the future effects of ocean acidification, scientists and engineers at MBARI have developed a technique and apparatus for an in situ perturbation experiment, the FOCE experimental platform. At the time of this writing the FOCE system and associated ESW are attached to the Monterey Accelerated Research System (MARS) cabled observatory. Engineering validation and tuning experiments using remote control and real time experimental feedback are underway. Additionally, an extensive instrumentation suite provides all of the necessary data for pH calculation and experimental control. The ESW is a separately deployed system that stores and distributes CO2 enriched seawater. It receives power and communications via an underwater mateable electrical tether. The CO2 enriched seawater is pumped into the FOCE sections from the ESW. This paper describes the design, development, and testing of the underwater ESW Distribution System as well as the software control algorithms as applied to FOCE. The paper covers the initial prototype, lessons learned, and the final operational version.","","","10.23919/OCEANS.2011.6107095","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6107095","ocean;acidification;pH;CO2;underwater;perturbation;chemistry;MARS;MBARI","Mars;Ocean temperature;Valves;Prototypes;Temperature measurement;Filling","carbon compounds;ocean chemistry;oceanographic equipment;oceanographic techniques;pH;seawater;underwater equipment","carbon dioxide enriched seawater distribution system;seawater-carbon dioxide reaction kinetics;ocean acidification;Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute;MBARI Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment experiments;deep water FOCE science experiments;in situ carbon dioxide enriched seawater source;atmospheric carbon dioxide levels;in situ perturbation experiment;Monterey Accelerated Research System;MARS cabled observatory;underwater mateable electrical tether;underwater ESW distribution system;CO2","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-speech events can reveal aspects of the scene that speakers miss or neglect to mention, which could further support speech enhancement and recognition systems with information about the surrounding noise. This paper focuses on the task of detecting and classifying acoustic events in a conversation scene where these often overlap with speech. State-of-the-art techniques are based on derived features (e.g. MFCC, or Mel-filter banks), which have successfully parameterized speech spectrograms, but that reduce both resolution and detail when we are targeting other kinds of events. In this paper, we propose a method that learns hidden features directly from spectrogram patches, and integrates them within the deep neural network framework to detect and classify acoustic events. The result is a model that performs feature extraction and classification simultaneously. Experiments confirm that the proposed method outperforms deep neural networks with derived features as well as related work on the CHIL2007-AED task, showing that there is room for further improvement.","","","10.1109/HSCMA.2014.6843263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843263","communication scene understanding;acoustic event detection;spectrogram patch","Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Spectrogram;Speech;Feature extraction;Conferences;Training","feature extraction;neural nets;speech enhancement;speech recognition","spectrogram patch based acoustic event detection;speech overlapping conditions;nonspeech events;speech enhancement;speech recognition system;parameterized speech spectrograms;deep neural network framework;feature extraction;feature classification;CHIL2007-AED task","","3","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At KIT the Focus Anthropomatics and Robotics - APR has been set up by a number of research groups focusing on the research field of Anthropomatics and Robotics with more than 250 researchers. Modelling humans and their capabilities requires a deep understanding of the principle of biomechanics and kinematics, as well as the underlaying neural control principles and the perceptive and actuatoric system. Modelling and understanding of the sensomotoric mechanisms, learning and developement of skills and cognititve capabilities to enable humans to interact with the world is of high importance to design technical systems operating closely and interactively with humans via various modalities like speech, haptics, vision, grasping and locomotion. Typical research fields are related to active vision, interpretation of scenes and human activities, recognition and tracking technologies multimodal & perceptual user interfaces, understanding and translation of speech. Complementary research needed is related to the retrieval & access and summarization of multimedia data sources, translation of spoken text, context aware learning computers, implicit services and many more. The robotics application field ranges from interactive industrial robotics, service robotic companions, humanoids and medical robotics. In all domains the integrating aspects are focusing on algorithms processing real word data as well as open self-organizing architectures which allow autonomy, skill and task learning as well as interaction with humans. Our research emphasizes the critical path from basic understanding of cognitive processes and robotics foundations to applications in various domains. The research includes new approaches to sensor and actuator methodologies, foundations of machine perception, motion and action planning algorithms, simulation and computer graphics, robot machine learning, speech recognition and understanding, multimodal man-machine interaction, and many others. APR addresses the needs of humans in smart living environments and robotics focusing on both, basic foundations and applications. The focus has an intellectual center point on Anthropomatics and a commitment to Robotics as a new human centered discipline. The research is to explore new ideas and to build systematically systems which reflect human daily needs and a basic understanding of intelligent robots and adaptive safe system behaviour in general. Such cognitive robots are able to do tasks skillfully and efficiently together with humans, and they should be able to operate in dangerous or inaccessible areas. Furthermore, future robots should discover new things and learn new capabilities and knowledge about their environment and they should be able to reason about the effects of their actions and interventions. Thus, the basic capabilities to perform intelligent actions in the real world are perception, cognition, locomotion and skillful manipulation. The humanoid robot series ARMAR is used to illustrate recent research and achieved results in the field.","","","10.1109/ROMAN.2011.6005213","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6005213","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We show that while uncorrelated fading channels can ruin the overall performance, the introduced natural randomization can potentially help the nodes leave deep fade spots.

Most existing models extract summaries by selecting the top sentences with highest scores without using the relationships between sentences, and usually represent the sentences simply basing on lexical or statistical features. As a result, those models can not achieve salience or coverage very well. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization model called Sentence Selection with Semantic Representation (SSSR). SSSR ensures both salience and coverage by learning semantic representations for sentences and applying a well-designed selection strategy to select summary sentences. The selection strategy used in SSSR is to select sentences that can reconstruct the original document with least distortion by means of linear combination. Besides, we improve our selection strategy by reducing redundant information. Then we learn two semantic representations for sentences: (1) weighted mean of word embeddings, (2) deep coding. Both of them are semantic and compact, and can capture similarities between sentences.

This work is motivated by the need to compactly and accurately encode variations at multiple scales in the shape representation in order to drive the segmentation and shape analysis of deep brain structures, such as the caudate nucleus or the hippocampus. Our proposed shape representation can be optimized to compactly encode shape variations in a population at the needed scale and spatial locations, enabling the construction of more descriptive, nonglobal, nonuniform shape probability priors to be included in the segmentation and shape analysis framework. In particular, this representation addresses the shortcomings of techniques that learn a global shape prior at a single scale of analysis and cannot represent fine, local variations in a population of shapes in the presence of a limited dataset. Specifically, our technique defines a multiscale parametric model of surfaces belonging to the same population using a compact set of spherical wavelets targeted to that population. We further refine the shape representation by separating into groups wavelet coefficients that describe independent global and/or local biological variations in the population, using spectral graph partitioning. We then learn a prior probability distribution induced over each group to explicitly encode these variations at different scales and spatial locations. Based on this representation, we derive a parametric active surface evolution using the multiscale prior coefficients as parameters for our optimization procedure to naturally include the prior for segmentation. Additionally, the optimization method can be applied in a coarse-to-fine manner. We apply our algorithm to two different brain structures, the caudate nucleus and the hippocampus, of interest in the study of schizophrenia. We show: 1) a reconstruction task of a test set to validate the expressiveness of our multiscale prior and 2) a segmentation task. In the reconstruction task, our results show that for a given training set size, our algorithm significantly improves the approximation of shapes in a testing set over the Point Distribution Model, which tends to oversmooth data. In the segmentation task, our validation shows our algorithm is computationally efficient and outperforms the Active Shape Model algorithm, by capturing finer shape details","","","10.1109/TMI.2007.893284","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4141198","Brain structures;schizophrenia;segmentation;shape representation;wavelets","Brain;Hippocampus;Testing;Active shape model;Wavelet transforms;Parametric statistics;Surface waves;Wavelet coefficients;Biological information theory;Probability distribution","biomedical MRI;brain;image coding;image reconstruction;image representation;medical image processing;optimisation;probability;wavelet transforms","multiscale 3-D shape representation;image segmentation;spherical wavelet transform;shape variation encoding;shape analysis;deep brain structures;caudate nucleus;hippocampus;shape probability;multiscale parametric model;wavelet coefficients;spectral graph partitioning;probability distribution;parametric active surface evolution;multiscale prior coefficients;optimization;schizophrenia;image reconstruction;point distribution model;MRI","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Brain;Humans;Image Enhancement;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Imaging, Three-Dimensional;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Numerical Analysis, Computer-Assisted;Pattern Recognition, Automated;Reproducibility of Results;Sensitivity and Specificity","57","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We argue that decomposing complex factoid questions is beneficial to QA systems, because the more facts that support an answer candidate, the more likely it is to be the correct answer. We broadly categorize decomposable questions into two types: parallel and nested. Parallel decomposable questions contain subquestions that can be evaluated independent of each other. Nested questions require decompositions to be processed in sequence, with the answer to an “inner” subquestion plugged into an “outer” subquestion. In this paper, we present a novel question decomposition framework capable of handling both decomposition types, built on top of the base IBM Watson™ QA system for Jeopardy!™. The framework contains a suite of decomposition rules that use predominantly lexico-syntactic features to identify facts within complex questions. It also contains a question-rewriting component and a candidate re-ranker, which uses machine learning and heuristic selection strategies to generate a final ranked answer list, taking into account answer confidences from the base QA system. We apply our decomposition framework to the particularly challenging domain of Final Jeopardy! questions, which are found to be difficult even for qualified Jeopardy! players, and we show a statistically significant improvement in the performance of our baseline QA system.","","","10.1147/JRD.2012.2188934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177726","","Context awareness;Companies;Syntactics;Machine learning;History;Complexity theory","","","","4","14","","","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The cerebellar controller drives eye compensation, by providing joint torque based on network output activity. We compared a cerebellar controller with only the cortical plasticity and a cerebellar controller with also the plasticity mechanisms at deep nuclei, in VOR multiple sessions.

Sky Net combines multiple techniques already developed individually in the literature to create an efficient and robust machine-learning tool that is able to train large and deep feed-forward neural networks for use in a wide range of learning applications, such as regression, classification, density estimation, clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sky Net uses a powerful `pre-training' method, to obtain a set of network parameters close to the true global maximum of the training objective function, followed by further optimisation using an automatically-regularised variant of Newton's method that uses second-order derivative information to improve convergence, but without the need to evaluate or store the full Hessian matrix, by using a fast approximate method to calculate Hessian-vector products. This combination of methods allows for the training of complicated networks that are difficult to optimise using standard back propagation techniques. The blind accelerated multimodal Bayesian inference (BAMBI) algorithm implements the MultiNest package for nested sampling as well as the training of an artificial neural network by Sky Net to learn the likelihood function. In the case of computationally expensive likelihoods, this allows the substitution of a much more rapid approximation in order to increase significantly the speed of the analysis.

We introduce a two layer, stacked, coder-pooler architecture where the first layer is specifically dedicated to extract, from our so-called Differential Vectors (DV) patches, some efficient, local low-level features more discriminative and efficient that their classic handcrafted counterpart. This first layer can advantageously replace any classic dense SIFT/HOG patches extraction stage. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets: UIUC-Sports, Scene 15 and Caltech 101. We achieve excellent performances with simple linear classification while using basic coding and pooling schemes for both layers, i.e. Sparse Coding (SC) and Max-Pooling (MP) respectively.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7294976","Scenes Categorization;Dictionary Learning;Sparse-coding;Max-pooling;Sparse Coding;Differential Vectors","Feature extraction;Encoding;Dictionaries;Computer architecture;Robustness;Image coding;Semantics","","","","","47","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these problems, we perform an extensive evaluation of many state-of-the-art detection approaches on vehicles. Our main contributions are: (1) we collect a large dataset of real-world vehicles in frontal/rear view with 30° ~ -30° yaw changes and 5° ~ 45° pitch changes under different weather conditions (snowy, rainy, sunny and cloudy) and illumination variations, and then (2) we evaluate six types of state-of-the-art features in Real AdaBoost framework on the adequate dataset collected by ourselves and a public dataset using the same evaluation protocol.

It is shown, that such sets are useful for synthesis of neural networks with a predetermined sequence of activity pattern. An algorithm for a NN interconnection matrix, giving robust decision to the problem is proposed and studied at length. Some results of a further analysis are presented for the NN of the Hebb-Hopfield (HH) type, i.e. for a NN whose interconnection matrix is the Hebb matrix of Hopfield. It is shown, that for the case, when the multi-ring activity set is a basic set for the HH network, minima of its Hopfield energy are at the bottom of deep ditches, corresponding to the basic set of network activity states for the HH NN. When neuron threshold fatigue is introduced, depending on its recent activity state, the network activity becomes cyclic, moving with a constant rate, depending on /spl lambda/ in one of the possible directions in the ring, depending on the initial conditions. The results are most interesting, when more than one full ring (say, two or more) are being used as a basic set for an HH matrix. The pairs of full rings with random, in relation to each other, enumerations (N=256) are being tested. Properties of excitation states in such networks in relation to each full ring of the HH network basic set are the same as properties of the single full ring based HH network activity.

This adaptation method depends on a joint learning of a large generic adaptation neural network for all speakers as well as multiple small speaker codes using the standard back-propagation algorithm. In this paper, we propose an alternative direct adaptation in model space, where speaker codes are directly connected to the original DNN models through a set of new connection weights, which can be estimated very efficiently from all or part of training data. As a result, the proposed method is more suitable for large scale speech recognition tasks since it eliminates the time-consuming training process to estimate another adaptation neural networks. In this work, we have evaluated the proposed direct SC-based adaptation method in the large scale 320-hr Switchboard task. Experimental results have shown that the proposed SC-based rapid adaptation method is very effective not only for small recognition tasks but also for very large scale tasks. For example, it has shown that the proposed method leads to up to 8% relative reduction in word error rate in Switchboard by using only a very small number of adaptation utterances per speaker (from 10 to a few dozens). Moreover, the extra training time required for adaptation is also significantly reduced from the method in [1].","","","10.1109/ICASSP.2014.6854824","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6854824","Deep Neural Network (DNN);Hybrid DNN-HMM;Speaker Code;Fast Speaker Adaptation","Neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Training;Adaptation models;Speech recognition;Training data;Speech","backpropagation;neural nets;speaker recognition;speech codecs","word error rate;switchboard task;direct SC-based adaptation method;adaptation neural networks;speaker codes;standard backpropagation algorithm;adaptation method;speech recognition;discriminative speaker code;speaker code;LVCSR;fast speaker adaptation;hybrid DNN-HMM model;direct adaptation;time 320 hr","","35","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a new monitoring method based on independent component analysis (ICA) - sparse autoencoder. The independent information component can be extracted by ICA through higher-order statistics. Moreover, the inherent nonlinear characteristics in the residual model of ICA can be handled by a deep architecture constructed with sparse autoencoder. To overcome the problem of local minima in the optimization of sparse autoencoder, a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is used to pre-train the net, and the parameters in the sparse autoencoder is updated by Limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS). Monitoring statistic is developed and its confidence limit is computed by kernel density estimation.

In contrast with RBMs, where the bottom layer of random variables is observed, inference in the FHRBM is intractable, scaling exponentially with the number of hidden units. We introduce variational algorithms for efficient approximate inference that scale linearly with the number of hidden units. Compared to traditional factorial models of noisy speech, which are based on GMMs, the FHRBM has the advantage that the representations of both speech and noise are highly distributed, allowing the model to learn a parts-based representation of noisy speech data that can generalize better to previously unseen noise compositions.

Searching for multiple strings that may start anywhere in the payload is a major obstacle to performance. Commercial systems often employ multiple network processors to provide parallel processing in general and use regex software engines or special regex processors to speed up searching performance via parallelism. Typically, regex rules are prepared separately from the application program and compiled into a binary image to be read by a regex processor or software engine. Our approach integrates specifying search rules with specifying network application code written in packet C, a C dialect that hides host-machine specifics, supports coarse-grain parallelism and supplies high-level data type and operator extensions for packet processing. packetC provides a search set data type, as well as match and find operations, to support payload searching.

In today's systems-on-a-chip, the delay through a wire is often greater than the delay through the gate driving it. Furthermore, because of significant parasitic effects, crosstalk between signals on wires can cause major problems. Improved management of the EMI problem is made possible via EDA tools which have the capability of accurately and efficiently modeling electromagnetic interference effects in nanoscale VLSI. However, existing tools are computationally expensive and do not have broad application. The novel methodology proposed in this paper involves topological decomposition of small portions of interconnect (referred to as wirecells) at an extreme level of detail and the creation of parameterized models of these primitive interconnect structures using modular artificial neural networks (MANNs). The technique uses a finite element method program coupled with a circuit simulator and a neural network multi-paradigm prototyping system to produce a library of standard MANN-based wirecell models. It is especially attractive because none of the existing approaches is capable of fully modeling the simultaneous effect on delay and crosstalk of several uncorrelated variables such as interconnect length, width, thickness, separation, metal and insulating medium conductivity and relative permittivity for multiple systems of conductors. The library models derived are used to predict delay noise and crosstalk resulting from interconnect structures embedded in actual analog and digital circuitry.","","","10.1109/6040.938293","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=938293","","Crosstalk;Neural networks;Integrated circuit interconnections;Electromagnetic interference;Artificial neural networks;Wafer scale integration;Delay systems;Wire;Electronic design automation and methodology;Electromagnetic modeling","integrated circuit interconnections;crosstalk;electromagnetic interference;neural nets;integrated circuit modelling;VLSI;finite element analysis;circuit simulation;integrated circuit noise;integrated circuit packaging;electronic design automation;learning by example;delay estimation;topology","crosstalk prediction;neural net-based topological decomposition;3D interconnect;electromagnetic interference effects;EMI problem;wirecell models;parameterized models;modular artificial neural networks;modular ANNs;finite element method program;circuit simulator;neural network multi-paradigm prototyping system;delay noise;library models;noise characterization;packaging;FEM program","","7","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

OLabs offers an excellent platform for the improvement of Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths (STEM) education which has been the focus of several countries in recent times. The current content in OLabs is 2 dimensional. 2D content comes with its own limitations of low accuracy and low realism and hence moving to browser based 3D representations is important to offer an enriching experience to the learner. WebGL offers the powerful capability of rendering 2D as well as 3D content in any browser without the need to install additional applications or components. With the advent of WebGL, writing 3D applications have become simpler since most details are abstracted from the programmer. New features are added almost every week in WebGL by the community making it rich and powerful.

A brief review of related literature shows that the concept of knowledge active forgetting (KAF) is a crucial aspect of organizational learning and knowledge management. However, many aspects of this topic deserve more attention by researchers. The main gap in the literature seems to be related to the linkage between peculiar aspects of knowledge (such as stickiness, context dependency, and collective ontology) on one hand, and the antecedents, process and consequences of KAF, on the other. Through a critical review of the related literature, we came up with major propositions regarding the link between different types and features of knowledge and the process of active forgetting. The main contribution of this paper is showing that taking into account such peculiarities of knowledge (tacit vs. explicit, synthetic vs. analytical, general vs. specific) could pave the way of deep understanding the process of active forgetting in organizations.","","","10.1109/PICMET.2009.5262028","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5262028","","Knowledge management;Technology management;Engineering management;Industrial engineering;Knowledge engineering;Systems engineering and theory;Couplings;Ontologies;Absorption","knowledge management;organisational aspects","knowledge management;knowledge active forgetting concept;organizational learning;organizational aspects","","","79","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The driving function for this move is the need to develop new products quickly, correctly and inexpensively. Time-to-market of four to six months are not uncommon today for some electronic systems. At the same time, there is a need to leverage maximally what deep sub-micron (DSM) technology has to offer to compete. Hence, an approach that has design re-use as its main goal has great potential to increase productivity of the industry as a whole. The basic tenets of the design methodology have been incorporated into the Cadence VCC environment for virtual component co-design. They are function-architecture co-design, mapping of functions to flexible and programmable architectures, and efficient and automatic implementation of actual code on the programmable components of the architecture. This paper illustrates these principles using the automotive applications as an example. Besides the different steps of the actual function architecture codesign methodology, the authors show and summarize the lessons learned from design projects. They outline how it has been possible to capture functions and candidate architectures and how the mapping of the functions to the candidate architectures can be carried out very quickly so as to converge to an ""optimal"" solution effectively and in a few iterations.","","","10.1109/IVEC.2001.961757","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=961757","","Automotive applications;Productivity;Automotive engineering;Computer architecture;Design methodology;Convergence;Network topology;Circuit topology;Electronic mail;Time to market","automobile industry;hardware-software codesign;CAD;design engineering","automotive applications;virtual component co-design;function architecture co-design;system design;time-to-market;deep sub-micron technology;candidate architectures;programmable components;flexible architectures","","2","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The surrounding environment affects the character and disposition of the people within it. The goal of our work is to automatically recognize the type of environments one is in. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchical structure to recognize environments using the surrounding audio. We can use this structure to discover high-level representations for different acoustic environments in a data-driven fashion. Being able to perform such function would allow us to better understand how we could utilize such information to assist in predicting a person's emotion or behavior. To accurately make an informative decision about behaviors or emotions, it is important to have the ability to differentiate between different types of environments. Environmental sound contains large variances even within a single environment and is constantly changing. These changes and events are dynamic and inconsistent. The goal is to come up with models that is robust enough to generalize to different situations. Learning a hierarchy of sound types would improve and clarify problems caused by the confusion between multiple acoustic environments with similar characteristics. We propose a framework for a composite of deep belief networks (composite-DBNs) as a way to represent various levels of representations and to recognize twelve different types of common everyday environments. Experimental results demonstrate promising performance in improving the state of art recognition for acoustic environments.","","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6411994","","Acoustics;Speech;Training;Speech recognition;Neural networks;Hidden Markov models;Noise measurement","acoustic applications;belief networks;emotion recognition","composite-DBN;environmental contexts;people behaviors;surrounding environment;hierarchical structure;surrounding audio;high-level representations;acoustic environments;informative decision;environmental sound;sound types;deep belief networks","","1","13","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These faults are rare but they have been known to cause catastrophic system-level failures. Transient errors often occur due to physical effects on deployed systems and hence, diagnosis of transient errors must be performed over manufactured chips or systems assembled from black-box components where arbitrary instrumentation of the system is not possible and hence, the system state is only partially observable. Further, these systems are often composed of components that are third party IP which further adds opaqueness to the system. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to localize transient faults in space and time for such partially observable systems. From a set of correct traces and a failure trace, we seek to locate the faulty component and the cycle of operation at which the fault occurred. Our technique uses correct system traces over monitored components of the system to learn a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) summarizing the temporal dependencies across the monitored components. This DBN is augmented with different error hypotheses allowed by the fault model. The most probable explanation (MPE) among these hypotheses corresponds to the most likely location of the error. We evaluated the effectiveness of our technique on a set of ISCAS89 benchmarks and a router design used in on-chip networks in a multi-core design.","","","10.1109/HLDVT.2009.5340170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5340170","","Bayesian methods;Computer bugs;Computer errors;Assembly systems;Condition monitoring;Manufacturing;Clocks;Error correction;Fault diagnosis;Semiconductor device manufacture","Bayes methods;integrated circuit reliability;system-on-chip;transients","transient faults;dynamic Bayesian networks;deep submicron semiconductor technology;system-level failures;black-box components;correct traces;failure trace;ISCAS89 benchmarks;router design;on-chip networks;multicore design;transient error debugging","","7","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When these SAD models are tested on audio recorded from radio channels not seen during training, there is severe performance degradation. We attribute this degradation to mismatches between the two dimensional filters learnt in the initial CNN layers and the novel channel data. Using a small amount of supervised data from the novel channels, the filters can be adapted to provide significant improvements in SAD performance. In mismatched acoustic conditions, the adapted models provide significant improvements (about 10-25%) relative to conventional DNN-based SAD systems.

Its general principle is to attempt to reproduce in a low-dimensional space the salient characteristics of data, such as proximities. A large variety of methods exist in the literature, ranging from principal component analysis to deep neural networks with a bottleneck layer. In this cornucopia, it is rather difficult to find out why a few methods clearly outperform others. This paper identifies two important properties that enable some recent methods like stochastic neighborhood embedding and its variants to produce improved visualizations of high-dimensional data. The first property is a low sensitivity to the phenomenon of distance concentration. The second one is plasticity, that is, the capability to forget about some data characteristics to better reproduce the other ones. In a manifold learning perspective, breaking some proximities typically allow for a better unfolding of data. Theoretical developments as well as experiments support our claim that both properties have a strong impact. In particular, we show that equipping classical methods with the missing properties significantly improves their results.","","","10.1109/CIDM.2014.7008663","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7008663","","Cost function;Vectors;Principal component analysis;Force;Plastics;Manifolds;Covariance matrices","data reduction;data structures;neural nets;principal component analysis","dimensionality reduction;DR;data representation;principal component analysis;deep neural networks","","8","35","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent examples of this shift are changing to using robots in the assembly line construction of automobiles or the increasing use of robotics for medical procedures. Most often this is done with cost-reduction in mind, though ease of use for the customer is also a driver. All industries experience the push to increase efficiency of their systems; National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the commercial space industry are no different. NASA space communication services are provided by three separately designed, developed, maintained, and operated communications networks known as the Deep Space Network (DSN), Near Earth Network (NEN) and Space Network (SN). The Space Communications and Navigation (SCaN) Program is pursuing integration of these networks and has performed a variety of architecture trade studies to determine what integration options would be the most effective in achieving a unified user mission support organization, and increase the use of common operational equipment and processes. The integration of multiple, legacy organizations and existing systems has challenges ranging from technical to cultural. The existing networks are the progeny of the very first communication and tracking capabilities implemented by NASA and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) more than 50 years ago and have been customized to the needs of their respective user mission base. The technical challenges to integrating the networks are many, though not impossible to overcome. The three distinct networks provide the same types of services, with customizable data rates, bandwidth, frequencies, and so forth. The differences across the networks have occurred in effort to satisfy their user missions' needs. Each new requirement has made the networks more unique and harder to integrate. The cultural challenges, however, have proven to be a significant obstacle for integration. Over the past few decades of use, user missions and network personnel alike have grown accustomed to the processes by which services are provided by the NASA communications and navigation networks. The culture established by each network has created several challenges that need to be overcome in order to effectively integrate the networks. As with any change, there has been resistance, an apprehension to explore automation of existing processes, and a working environment that attempts to indirectly influence change without mandating compliance. Overcoming technical and cultural challenges is essential to successfully integrating the networks and although the challenges are numerous, the integration of the networks promises a more efficient space communications network for NASA and its customers, as well as potential long-term cost savings to the agency.This paper, Challenges of Integrating NASA Legacy Communications Networks, will provide a brief overview of the current NASA space communications networks as well as the an overview of the process implemented while performing the SCaN Trade Studies and an introduction to the requirements driving integration of the SCaN Networks. This paper will describe in detail the challenges experienced, both technical and cultural, while working with NASA space communications network-specific personnel.

The general public is less likely to learn anything directly from a stream of data (Figure 2) unless it is put into some kind of spatial or temporal context. We calculate anomalies in key parameters and track them as they transit between moorings or evolve with time.

However, exploitation of DS technology will depend critically on the availability of global system engineers able to bridge the gap between software-centric system thinking and hardware-software implementation, in novel silicon architectures. This requires a rethinking of present engineering schools which are not well equipped to tackle global system engineering aspects. The concept of design institute is introduced where, based on visionary system design demonstrators, new methodologies, tools, libraries and courses are created and distributed over the global network.

For example, when performing segmentation, local constraints on the shape can help where the object boundary is noisy or unclear, and global constraints can resolve ambiguities where background clutter looks similar to part of the object. In general, the stronger the model of shape, the more performance is improved. In this paper, we use a type of Deep Boltzmann Machine [22] that we call a Shape Boltzmann Machine (ShapeBM) for the task of modeling binary shape images. We show that the ShapeBM characterizes a strong model of shape, in that samples from the model look realistic and it can generalize to generate samples that differ from training examples.

However, previously proposed implementations have a variety of characteristics that make them challenging to implement in future high-performance processors. In particular, the original perceptron branch predictor suffers from a long access latency, and the faster path-based neural predictor (PBNP) requires deep pipelining and additional area to support checkpointing for mis-prediction recovery. The complexity of the PBNP predictor stems from the fact that the path history length, which determines the number of tables and pipeline stages, is equal to the history length, which is typically very long for high accuracy. We propose to decouple the path-history length from the outcome-history length through a new technique called modulo-path history. By allowing a shorter path history, we can implement a PBNP with significantly fewer tables and pipeline stages while still exploiting a traditional long branch outcome history. The pipeline length reduction results in decreased power and implementation complexity. We also propose folded modulo-path history to allow the number of pipeline stages to differ from the path history length. We show that our modulo-path PBNP at 8KB can achieve prediction accuracy and overall performance within 0.8% (SPECint) of the original PBNP while simultaneously reducing predictor energy consumption by ~29% per access and predictor die area by ~35%. Our folded modulo-path history PBNP achieves performance within 1.3% of ideal, with a ~37% energy reduction and ~36% predictor area reduction","","","10.1109/SBAC-PAD.2006.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4032416","","History;Pipeline processing;Energy consumption;Accuracy;Delay;Machine learning algorithms;Random access memory;Computer science;Educational institutions;Checkpointing","neural net architecture;parallel architectures;pipeline processing","high-performance processors;neural branch predictors;path-based neural predictor;pipeline length reduction;folded modulo-path history;path-history length;outcome-history length","","2","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This technique takes a spectroscopic training set, and maps the photometric attributes, but not the redshifts, to a two-dimensional surface by using a process of competitive learning where neurons compete to more closely resemble the training data multidimensional space. The key feature of a SOM is that it retains the topology of the input set, revealing correlations between the attributes that are not easily identified. We test three different 2D topological mapping: rectangular, hexagonal and spherical, by using data from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey. We also explore different implementations and boundary conditions on the map and also introduce the idea of a random atlas, where a large number of different maps are created and their individual predictions are aggregated to produce a more robust photometric redshift PDF. We also introduced a new metric, the I-score, which efficiently incorporates different metrics, making it easier to compare different results (from different parameters or different photometric redshift codes). We find that by using a spherical topology mapping we obtain a better representation of the underlying multidimensional topology, which provides more accurate results that are comparable to other, state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Our results illustrate that unsupervised approaches have great potential for many astronomical problems, and in particular for the computation of photometric redshifts.","","","10.1093/mnras/stt2456","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8181268","methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;surveys;galaxies: distances and redshifts;galaxies: statistics","","","","","2","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

To overcome the problems of weights allocation and determination which exists on the mould of traditional grey relation analysis, a weighted grey relation analysis method was modified to solve the problems. The criteria weight obtained by applying analytical hierarchy process approach, and the grey relational analysis approach used to get the measure of college English teaching assessment are highly logical, practical and systemic. Theoretical and experimental results show that the model is effective and is also suitable for English teaching quality assessment in higher education.","","","10.1109/FSKD.2013.6816189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6816189","teaching quality;college English evaluation;grey relation analysis;AHP","Educational institutions;Indexes;Optimization;Geology;Statistical analysis;Design methodology","analytic hierarchy process;further education;grey systems;teaching","college English teaching assessment;grey relational analysis;educational system;teaching quality evaluation;higher learning;undergraduate students;weights allocation;weighted grey relation analysis method;analytical hierarchy process approach","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There have been published neurobiological experiments where rats were found to have hippocampal cell activations that positively correlate with the location of the animal by J.Bures, et al. (1997). Such activations found in the hippocampal region are usually called place fields (PF) or place cells (PC). The place field model presented in this paper was designed using a unique k-means fast learning artificial neural network (KFLANN) by L.P. Wong et al. (2003) and establishes a series of localization minima points that act as references for navigation. While such evidence of place cells are seen in hippocampal (CA1) and deep layers of the entorhinal cortex (EC) by Loren M.Frank, et al (2000), a literature search indicates it is uncertain whether any applications were ever designed using such biological evidence. This paper aims to focus on experimental results relevant for a proof-of-concept of robot localization, rather than illustrating a robustly tested navigation system. As such, basic ultrasonic based experiments will suffice. We use some experimental results, to show that KFLANN is suitable for implementing atomic place field vectors (APFV), a data structure to encapsulate localization information.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2006.246970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1716679","","Robot localization;Navigation;Biological system modeling;Robot sensing systems;Biosensors;Rats;Animals;Artificial neural networks;Cells (biology);Robustness","neural nets;robots","hippocampal inspired robot localization;ultrasonic sensor;place field model;k-means fast learning artificial neural network;entorhinal cortex","","2","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Continuous relationship with customer and customer process supports life cycle learning and knowledge catching. Whole the value network around the customer process is continuously searching balance between effectiveness and profitability over the life cycle. Business transition is difficult to execute if the networked business is not understood from system point of view through ""big picture"" of the business and if suitable collaborative performance metrics is not used. There have been many attempts to describe industrial service in the form of ""big picture"". Some of them have been too complicated, some too simple, some are biased serving only single point of view. Service excellence means understanding of the whole business picture. That system model leads us to the roots of service excellence. Service excellence can be continuously measured and followed by indicators looking from various viewpoints. Some of the indicators are based on balance scorecard key performance indicators. Some of the viewpoints are such that there have not been used any indicators. Emotional aspects or future service opportunities are not yet addressed by any indicators. Emotional factors become more and more important on service implementation. Enterprise brand image is also important in successful service marketing. By mastering innovation in open environment over customer process life cycle it is possible to achieve leadership in life cycle business transition. Innovation is taking place in three dimensions, business, customer and life cycle innovation. Spiral innovation process over the three dimensions of this hybrid innovation enables new type of business transition with lower risk level. Business co evolution is taking place on boundaries of business models, networks and deliverables. Performance metrics should align to translate vision to action and establish the criteria for business process optimization.

We show that if the additive GPs are supposed to be locally-stationary, computations can be done very efficiently in the frequency domain. These findings establish a deep connection between GP and nonnegative tensor factorizations with the Itakura-Saito distance and we show that when the signals are monodimensional, the resulting framework coincides with many popular methods that are based on nonnegative matrix factorization and time-frequency masking.","","","10.1109/SSP.2011.5967715","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5967715","Gaussian Processes;Nonnegative Tensor Factorization;Source Separation;Probability Theory;Regression","Tensile stress;Frequency modulation;Covariance matrix;Source separation;Gaussian processes;Fourier transforms;Presses","Gaussian processes;matrix decomposition;mean square error methods;regression analysis;source separation;tensors;time-frequency analysis","multidimensional signal separation;Gaussian processes;machine learning;multivariate random variables;underdetermined source separation;multidimensional spaces;GP regression model;minimum mean squared error estimates;frequency domain;nonnegative tensor factorizations;Itakura-Saito distance;nonnegative matrix factorization;time-frequency masking","","2","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, given a large set of possible transformations, selecting a compact subset is challenging. Indeed, all transformations are not equally informative and adding uninformative transformations increases training time with no gain in accuracy. We propose a principled algorithm -- Image Transformation Pursuit (ITP) -- for the automatic selection of a compact set of transformations. ITP works in a greedy fashion, by selecting at each iteration the one that yields the highest accuracy gain. ITP also allows to efficiently explore complex transformations, that combine basic transformations. We report results on two public benchmarks: the CUB dataset of bird images and the ImageNet 2010 challenge. Using Fisher Vector representations, we achieve an improvement from 28.2% to 45.2% in top-1 accuracy on CUB, and an improvement from 70.1% to 74.9% in top-5 accuracy on ImageNet.

Previous approaches relied heavily on expert input through the painstaking analysis of data to relate speech signals to the word sequences that produced them. Such methodologies were completely displaced by casting the speech recognition problem in a probabilistic framework by modeling the joint probability distribution of speech signals and word sequences. At the beginning of the 21st century, the amount of data and computation to train and build models has increased exponentially, and the emergence of new machine-learning algorithms and methodologies has opened new vistas in approaching complex pattern recognition problems. This is enabled by a new set of machine-learning techniques referred to as graphical models, with computationally tractable training algorithms. Closely related are neural-network modeling techniques, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the application of neural-network concepts, such as deep networks to speech recognition. The explosion of data has caused the development of new ways to capture the key features in massive amounts of data using efficient methods deploying exemplar-based sparse representations. Lastly, all of these different approaches can be tied together in a principled fashion using another variation of graphical models: an exponential model framework. This paper describes the current state of the art in speech recognition systems and highlights the developments that are expected to produce major breakthroughs in our ability to automatically recognize speech using computers.","","","10.1147/JRD.2011.2163277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032775","","Speech recognition;Feature extraction;Acoustics;Hidden Markov models;Adaptation models;Computational modeling","","","","3","","","","","","IBM","IBM Journals"
"The Oracle: A student perspective of Nathan Marcuvitz","E. E. Kunhardt","Polytechnic Institute of New York, USA","2011 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium","","2011","","","1","1","I got to know Marc through three different portals: student, colleague and under-study. My intent is to share with you my insights into the man and the scholar. As a student, the conversation within our student group followed a common script. One of us would ask, for example, ""Can any of you expand on the notion that quasi-mode representations of the dynamics of weakly correlated fluctuations can be interpreted in terms of 'quasi-particles' moving in their phase-space?"" The answer invariably was: ""You best go and see 'The Oracle'"". Before going to The Oracle, more formally known as Professor Nathan Marcuvitz, however, required a ""build-up"" of courage; you had to be sharp and ready for the deep exchange that was sure to happen. But the rewards were great, as Marc's explanations were lucid, thorough, precise, comprehensive and with a mixture of specifics and global context. I still have all the notebooks from the courses I took with him, such as Plasma Turbulence, Plasma Dynamics, Non-linear Wave Propagation and Kinetic Theory. His lectures, clear and engaging, have served as template for developing my own courses. And then, there was the ""seminar course"". I learned how to distill every bit of information out of a paper; I remember vividly the readings on non linear wave propagation and going through the evolving numerical techniques for solving the Kortweg-deVries and non-linear Schrodinger equation. In my PhD thesis, I took the Dyadic-Greens function approach to the description of linear space-time dependent fields, which Marc summarizes in his book with Leo Felsen in Radiation and Scattering of Waves, to arrive at a description of non linear plasma-surface waves and discover that they undergo wave packet bifurcation. Eight years after my graduation, it was time for me to return to Poly. The plan was to expand the activities of the Microwave Research Institute (MRI) by including the work I was doing in Gaseous Electronics and to re-name the Institute in honor of Ernst Weber, its first director and Marc's thesis advisor. A bit nervous, I took up Marc's invitation to spend a weekend with him and his wife Muriel at their home in Great Neck, Long Island. This was the first of a number of weekends ""at the Marcuvitz"" imagine, I was 'hanging out with the Oracle', if my buddies only knew! When my wife Christine and I decided to move back to New York, Marc and Muriel became our ""welcome wagon"". We discovered the gentle, caring, helpful, un-selfish, funny, witty, playful side of Marc and the beautiful relationship that he and Muriel had. Christine and I learned much from ""hanging out with the Marcuvitz"", including how to buy a house! Lacking experience in being director of an institute, I once again turned to Marc for advice, not so much technical advice on guiding the institute forward and acting like a statement. Marc was the personification of statesmanship. He had been both Director of MRI and also Dean of Faculty at Poly. He was smooth, articulate, clear thinking, attentive to both vision and details and, most of all, self assured. This learning period with Marc ultimately influenced my decision to pursue academic administration, culminating in my becoming Poly's Provost. My memory of Marc: the quintessential ""Professor"" in Harris Tweeds and comfortable shoes, of humble ways and great heart, all adorning a giant of a scholar.","","","10.1109/MWSYM.2011.5972866","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5972866","","Plasmas;Magnetic resonance imaging;Fluctuations;Neck;Scattering;Kinetic theory","biographies;history;kinetic theory;Schrodinger equation","student perspective;colleague;under-study;quasi-mode representations;quasi-particles;plasma dynamics;plasma turbulence;nonlinear wave propagation;kinetic theory;numerical techniques;Kortweg-deVries;nonlinear Schrodinger equation;microwave research institute;gaseous electronics;MRI;academic administration;Nathan Marcuvitz","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, training this simple model can be laborious. Traditional learning algorithms often converge only with the right choice of metaparameters that specify, for example, learning rate scheduling and the scale of the initial weights. They are also sensitive to specific data representation. An equivalent RBM can be obtained by flipping some bits and changing the weights and biases accordingly, but traditional learning rules are not invariant to such transformations. Without careful tuning of these training settings, traditional algorithms can easily get stuck or even diverge. In this letter, we present an enhanced gradient that is derived to be invariant to bit-flipping transformations.

However, innovation and deep integration in design and test tools has not kept pace with the consumerization of electronics and the rapidly evolving nanometer IC design and manufacturing. As a result, the full potential of Test has not been harnessed by the mainstream semiconductor community. The consumerization of electronics places significant new demands on low power, correctness and time-to-volume production. The Test technologies need to innovate at a faster pace to enable system companies and their semiconductor suppliers - in segments ranging from automotive to entertainment and multi-media to meet these new challenges. The rapid advances in nanometer technologies pose another set of challenges, primarily related to integration. Whereas the integration at the level of interoperability amongst different tools in the design and implementation flows has been adequate in the past, nanometer technology introduces new levels of complexity due to the advanced physics effects and higher scales of transistor integration. This in turn results in complex interaction and interdependence amongst the different design steps such as synthesis, test, floor planning, placement, routing and chip finishing. The EDA industry needs to establish a new paradigm and a ""deep integration"" to meet these challenges and to deliver the productivity gains that will enable our customers to meet demands on functionality, correctness, quality and time-to-volume production. The paradigm needs to shift from ""Design For Test"" to ""Design With Test"", to fully model the tight interdependencies between design and test. During the design phase, DFT steps must integrate well during the design architecture, synthesis, timing and layout steps. Later, during the manufacturing phase, the benefits of DFT must be seamlessly harnessed for rapid scan diagnostics based yield learning using not only logic information from the design database but also using timing and layout information. Such advances in innovation and integration will go a long way in moving the EDA industry from being a supplier of point tools to the role of a partner proactively anticipating and delivering on customers' needs.

We examine the relationship between the number of deep strategies employed and the usefulness of the mathematical model produced in solving an MEA in an undergraduate engineering course. A task model was created to represent the areas for strategy deployment, as well as to specify shallow and deep strategies utilized by student teams in these areas. Student work products were coded according to this model and data was analyzed using non-parametric statistical analyses. By explicitly modeling the problem-solving strategies, optimal pathways for task success were highlighted, providing information for instructors on valuable feedback for students engaging in the activity, as well as validation of holistic assessments of student work. This analysis also has implications for determining the specific learning that occurs during a complex problem-solving activity.","","","10.1109/FIE.2009.5350528","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5350528","Assessment;Engineering Education;Model-Eliciting Activities;Task Analysis","Mathematical model;Statistical analysis;Problem-solving;Testing;Mathematics;Data analysis;Feedback;Engineering education;Analytical models;Design engineering","engineering education;statistical analysis","student task model method;model-eliciting activity;client-driven situations;classroom settings;design-test-revise cycles;undergraduate engineering course;strategy deployment;non-parametric statistical analyses;problem-solving strategies;optimal pathways;complex problem-solving activity","","","7","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Metasearch is a very popular mechanism to search deep web. Metasearch provides the capability for users to search and access all of the information sources in one query submission. One of the fundamental problems in building metasearch systems is to learn wrappers which extract and integrate data records from query result pages returned from online sources. In this paper, develop an unsupervised approach for wrapper induction that combines visual, content and HTML tag information. Our approach first learns a visual content model that alleviates HTML tag differences among data records, and then finds a tag model from all data records that match the visual content model.

The representation captures abstracts of many data and is used as general features to solve many types of classification problems. A neural network is applied to natural language processing, too. In natural language processing neural networks achieve the best distributed representation of words and many researchers pay attention to the neural network language model. The distributed representation allocates words in a continuous feature space and there are semantically or syntactically similar words near area in the space. Hence, the distributed representation contributes to a solution of analogical reasoning tasks. In this paper a sparse neural network language model (SNNLM) is used, which achieves sparse active neurons in the hidden layer and a distributed representation of words is obtained. In evaluational experiments SNNLM selects words that do not occur in the same sentence at all as related words and it is confirmed that the word selection is appropriate manually.","","","10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913361","Natural language processing;Neural network","Biological neural networks;Neurons;Mathematical model;Equations;Vectors;Natural language processing","natural language processing;neural nets;word processing","distributed word representation;sparse neural network language model;SNNLM;sparse active neurons;word selection;natural language processing","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Neural network modelling and classification of lithofacies using well log data: A case study from KTB borehole site","S. Maiti; R. Krishna Tiwari; H. Kümpel","NA; NA; NA","Geophysical Journal International","","2007","169","2","733","746","A novel approach based on the concept of super self-adapting back propagation (SSABP) neural network has been developed for classifying lithofacies boundaries from well log data. The SSABP learning paradigm has been applied to constrain the lithofacies boundaries by parameterzing three sets of well log data, that is, density, neutron porosity and gamma ray obtained from the German Continental Deep Drilling Project (KTB). A multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural networks model was generated in a supervised feed-forward mode for training the published core sample data. A total of 351 pairs of input and output examples were used for self-adaptive network learning and weight and bias values were appropriately updated during each epoch according to the gradient-descent momentum scheme. The actual data analysis suggests that the SSABP network is able to emulate the pattern of all three sets of KTB data and identify lithofacies boundaries correctly. The comparisons of the maximum likelihood geological sections with the available geological information and the existing geophysical findings over the KTB area suggest that, in addition to the known main lithofacies boundaries units, namely paragneisses, metabasites and heterogeneous series containing partly calc-silicate bearing paragneisses-metabasites and alternations of former volcano-sedimentary sequences, the SSABP neural network technique resolves more detailed finer structures embedded in bigger units at certain depths over the KTB region which seems to be of some geological significance. The efficacy of the method and stability of results was also tested in presence of different levels of coloured noise. The test results suggest that the designed network topology is considerably unwavering for up to 20 per cent correlated noise; however, adding more noise (∼50 per cent or more) degrades the results. Our analyses demonstrate that the SSABP based approach renders a robust means for the classification of complex lithofacies successions from the KTB borehole log data and thus may provide useful guide/information for understanding the crustal inhomogeneity and structural discontinuity in many other regions.","","","10.1111/j.1365-246X.2007.03342.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8230458","ANN;back propagation method;KTB boreholes;lithofacies;petrophysics;well log","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Conventionally, one of the most popular learning formulations of data structure processing is backpropagation through structures (BPTS) [C. Goller et al., (1996)]. The BPTS algorithm has been successfully applied to a number of learning tasks that involved structural patterns such as image, shape, and texture classifications. However, this BPTS typed algorithm suffers from the long-term dependency problem in learning very deep tree structures. In this paper, we propose the genetic evolution for this data structures processing. The idea of this algorithm is to tune the learning parameters by the genetic evolution with specified chromosome structures. Also, the fitness evaluation as well as the adaptive crossover and mutation for this structural genetic processing are investigated in this paper. An application to flowers image classification by a structural representation is provided for the validation of our method. The obtained results significantly support the capabilities of our proposed approach to classify and recognize flowers in terms of generalization and noise robustness.","","","10.1109/TKDE.2005.28","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1377173","Index Terms- Adaptive processing of data structures;genetic algorithm;image classification;and neural networks.","Data structures;Image classification;Backpropagation algorithms;Pattern recognition;Neural networks;Shape;Tree data structures;Biological cells;Genetic mutations;Noise robustness","tree data structures;image classification;image texture;backpropagation;neural nets;genetic algorithms;image representation;image segmentation;feature extraction;visual databases","structural pattern recognition;genetic evolution processing;neural networks representation;data structure processing;backpropagation through structures algorithm;flowers image texture classification;long-term dependency problem;tree structures;chromosome structures;adaptive crossover","","19","30","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most robots don't completely support internal/external rotation, one of 3 DOF in the shoulder joint. This is because the internal/external rotation is performed by the activities of the rotator cuff, which consists of deep layer muscles. In other words, it is difficult to recognize the surface electromyogram (SEMG) signals, which are generated at muscles far from the skin. In this paper, our aim is to quantify the differences in the SEMG, between the surface layer and deep layer muscles and apply them to the discrimination of the external rotation under the experimental evaluation with twelve young subjects. Four kinds of parameters, such as zero crossing (ZC), were selected to express the characteristic of high frequency component in the EMG signal. Specifically, the classification was shown to be 97% successful by applying two features to the learning machine. Hence, it is almost possible to assume that either the deep or the surface muscle is active and discriminate the motions which their muscles involve.","","","10.1109/ROBIO.2006.340189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4142111","EMG;rotator cuff;shoulder;external rotation","Electromyography;Muscles;Electrodes;Shoulder;Wire;Educational technology;Skin;Rotation measurement;Robot kinematics;Biomimetics","biomechanics;electromyography;handicapped aids;medical signal processing;robots","rotator cuff activity etimation;shoulder external rotation;exoskeletal robots;upper limb motion;3 DOF;shoulder joint;internal rotation;surface electromyogram signals;muscles;zero crossing","","3","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the observation of direct outcomes of this theory on mundane objects is impossible because they can only be witnessed when travelling at relative speeds approaching the velocity of light c. These effects are so counterintuitive and contradicting with our daily understanding of space and time that physics students find it hard to learn relativity beyond mathematical equations and to understand the deep implications of the theory. Advances in Computer Graphics and Interaction Technology now make it possible to actually experiment the effects of relativity in a 3D immersive environment. We propose a Virtual Reality framework to study and learn relativity as well as to develop some intuition of the relativistic effects and the quadri-dimensional reality of space-time. More precisely, an innovative rendering engine and a non-Newtonian physics engine are combined to compute relativistic effects. Experiments are proposed within a game-oriented carom billiard environment. Our work improves over previous efforts in the ability i) to render in real-time multiple relativistic objects, each moving with a different velocity vector ii) to enable interactions between objects and iii) to enable the user to interact with the objects and modify the scene dynamically. The originality of our 4D rendering engine lies in its capacity to efficiently store and retrieve non-simultaneous past space-time events that are visible by an observer at a specific location and at a given instant of his proper time.","","","10.1109/VR.2011.5759468","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5759468","","Rendering (computer graphics);Physics;Observers;Relativistic effects;Real time systems;Virtual reality","computer aided instruction;computer games;interactive systems;physics computing;rendering (computer graphics);virtual reality","special relativity;physics;computer graphics;interaction technology;3D immersive environment;virtual reality framework;quadridimensional space time reality;nonNewtonian physics engine;game oriented carom billiard environment;4D rendering engine","","5","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Managers and employees have had to endure a deep recession and the accompanying redundancies. Those people who have retained their jobs now may be responsible for departed co-workers' duties as well as their duties. Technology is looked at as a solution to increasing productivity and helping employees cope with information overload. Many companies have installed computer networks and have expected employees to learn and begin using computer software programs and e-mail systems. Yet technology is only one part of the solution to managing information overload. This is the information age, but instead of feeling empowered by information and new technologies, many people are overwhelmed by the shear volume of information that they have to deal with, and the new skills they need to learn. In order to cope with information overload, and to truly increase personal efficiency, a new strategy needs to be developed, a Personal Information Management Strategy (PIM Strategy). A PIM Strategy relies on more than just useful technological or paper-based tools. While the right tools are very important to a PIM Strategy, they are not the only ingredient.

"Current fault management trends in NASA's planetary spacecraft","L. M. Fesq","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, 91109, USA","2009 IEEE Aerospace conference","","2009","","","1","9","Fault management for today's space missions is a complex problem, going well beyond the typical safing requirements of simpler missions. Recent missions have experienced technical issues late in the project lifecycle, associated with the development and test of fault management capabilities, resulting in both project schedule delays and cost overruns. Symptoms seem to become exaggerated in the context of deep space and planetary missions, most likely due to the need for increased autonomy and the limited communications opportunities with Earth-bound operators. These issues are expected to cause increasing challenges as the spacecraft envisioned for future missions become more capable and complex. In recognition of the importance of addressing this problem, the Discovery and New Frontiers Program Office hosted a Fault Management Workshop on behalf of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Planetary Science Division, to bring together experts in fault management from across NASA, DoD, industry and academia. The scope of the workshop was focused on deep space and planetary robotic missions, with full recognition of the relevance of, and subsequent benefit to, Earth-orbiting missions. Three workshop breakout sessions focused the discussions to target three topics: 1) fault management architectures, 2) fault management verification and validation, and 3) fault management development practices, processes and tools. The key product of this three-day workshop is a NASA White Paper that documents lessons learned from previous missions, recommended best practices, and future opportunities for investments in the fault management domain. This paper summarizes the findings and recommendations that are captured in the white paper.","","","10.1109/AERO.2009.4839530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4839530","","Space vehicles;Space missions;NASA;Life testing;Project management;Job shop scheduling;Delay;Costs;Context;Service robots","fault location;risk management;space vehicles","NASA planetary spacecraft;space missions;project lifecycle;Earth-orbiting missions;planetary robotic missions;fault management architecture;fault management verification;fault management development practices","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have developed an optical communication system that complements and integrates with an acoustic system to provide underwater communications that is capable of high data-rates and low latency in clear water combined with long range and robustness in the presence of high turbidity. This combined optical/acoustic telemetry technology was recently tested at a CORK (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit) borehole observatory in the deep ocean of northeast Pacific. A CORK is a seafloor system to seal a borehole from the overlying ocean to allow the subseafloor hydrologic regime within the sediments and volcanic basement to retain its pre-drilling pressure state. CORKs are instrumented with downhole thermistor strings and pressure sensors and are typically visited on a semi-regular basis by submersible for downloading data and for collecting physical samples of subsurface fluids. We deployed the Optical Telemetry System (OTS) at the Hole 857D CORK in 2420 m water depth using the submersible ALVIN in July, 2010. The OTS was plugged into the existing underwater connector on the CORK to provide not only an optical and acoustic communication interface but also additional data storage and battery power for the CORK to sample at an increased 1 Hz data-rate. Using a CTD-mounted OTS similar to the seafloor unit we were able to establish an optical communication link at a range of 100 meters at rates of 1, 5 and 10 mega bits per second (Mbps) with no bit errors. Subsequent tests were done to establish the optical range of the various data rates and the optical power of the system. After approximately 1 week we repeated the CTD-OTS experiment and downloaded 20 Mb of data over a 5 Mbps link at a range of 80 m. The CORK-OTS will remain installed at the CORK for a year. Our Optical Telemetry System (OTS) enables faster data rates to be employed for in situ measurements that were previously limited by data download times from a submersible. The OTS also permits non submersible-equipped vessels to interrogate the CORK borehole observatory on a more frequent basis using a receiver lowered by wire from a ship of opportunity. In the future, autonomous vehicles could interrogate such seafloor observatories in a ""data-mule"" configuration and then dock at a seafloor cabled node to download data. While borehole observatories may ultimately be linked into undersea cables relaying real-time data back to shore they represent a superb opportunity to test free water optical communication methods. This application of seafloor optical communication could be used for a number of other types of seafloor sensors that may not be linked into a cabled network. The lessons learned from our CORK development efforts will go a long way towards establishing the viability of underwater optical communications for a host of autonomous seafloor sensor systems in the future.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.2010.5663951","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5663951","","Optical fiber communication;Optical receivers;Optical sensors;High speed optical techniques;Acoustics;Optical transmitters;Underwater vehicles","marine telemetry;oceanographic equipment;seafloor phenomena;underwater optical wireless communication","data download times;autonomous vehicles;data-mule configuration;free water optical communication;seafloor optical communication;autonomous seafloor sensor systems;optical communication system;Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit;CORK seafloor observatory bandwidth;underwater communication;optical-acoustic telemetry;optical telemetry system;subseafloor hydrologic regime;downhole thermistor strings;pressure sensors;depth 2420 m;bit rate 5 Mbit/s;bit rate 10 Mbit/s","","17","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These advances have enabled considerable gains in knowledge and prediction of energy capture by human and infrahuman bodies as functions of wavelength and orientation of an object in the field. Complementing these advances are those by Eastern investigators, who have performed many epidemiological surveys and have pioneered studies of behavioral and nervous reactions to long-term, low-level irradiation. The resulting accretion of data, including those from international programs of scientific exchange, will help provide a sound basis for standards of safety and for beneficial applications of radio frequency energy.

This is an interim report in an investigation of the feasibility of air-to-air multispectral techniques that will generate the basis for a planned follow-on effort. The BAMS effort is developing the capability to detect ground targets in deep-hide and under camouflage by exploiting the spectral characteristics of the target. These same benefits should be adaptable for aerial search. This method of detection is more immune to low contrast or high clutter than a broadband sensor, and allows the use of larger pixels which translates into a much larger search volume. The downside is that the smaller wavebands inherent to multispectral sensors results in a smaller number of collected photons limiting the overall range capability. However, it is expected that multispectral sensors will have a distinct advantage over broadband sensors in the look-down scenario where the background is highly cluttered and the target is low contrast This scenario will be used for a direct comparison between the two sensor approaches. The methodology for determining the detection range capabilities for broadband and multispectral sensors is presented in this paper along with a summary of the approach for determining the expected performance of multispectral aerial search sensors.","","","10.1109/NAECON.1998.710129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=710129","","Infrared sensors;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Atmospheric modeling;Aircraft;Magnesium compounds;Target tracking;Infrared detectors;Electrooptic devices;Noise level;Signal to noise ratio","infrared detectors;military equipment;data acquisition;aircraft instrumentation","multispectral infrared sensors;modeling;air-to-ground scenario;air-to-air scenario;search and track;multispectral techniques;ground targets;spectral characteristics;aerial search;broadband sensor;multispectral sensors;broadband sensors","","","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The services (or APIs) are also usually accompanied by user facing Web applications for human-consumption. Canonical examples are Google Maps, Yahoo! Flykr and del.icio.us, EVDB's Eventful's application and API, Amazon.com's S3, ECS, Alexa, and many others. The Ruby programming language and its Rails framework are ideal for programming Web applications and services in the Web 2.0.

Both of these efforts are based on the same optical telemetry concept designed for high bandwidth, deep water, and 100+ meter range operations. To demonstrate the basic capabilities of data harvesting from a seafloor node, we installed optical modems at two seafloor CORK borehole observatories (CORK 857D and CORK 1025C) in the northeast Pacific in 2012 using ROV Jason. The seafloor optical modems enable remote data offload directly to the surface without the need for a submersible. The original concept of the demonstration was to revisit the installed CORK optical modems after a year-long deployment in order to test an OTS lowered by wire from a ship and to utilize the autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) Sentry for a remote data off-load. Due to scheduling issues related to the submersible Alvin program and shiptime, we were unable to field the experiment as first conceived. However, we were fortunate to obtain a short amount of shiptime on a research vessel with modest capabilities in terms of station keeping - i.e., no dynamic positioning, no bow thruster, and no ultrashort baseline (USBL) navigation - in order to download data after a year-long deployment. In this paper, we report on the successful data harvesting mission from two seafloor CORK observatory nodes using a “ship of opportunity.” The lessons learned from this exercise will inform our next scheduled trip in 2014 to use AUV Sentry or similar “mobile platforms” for future remote data downloads.","","","10.23919/OCEANS.2013.6740998","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6740998","underwater optical communications;freespace;optical modem;underwater wireless communications","Modems;Optical sensors;Optical fiber communication;High-speed optical techniques;Optical receivers;Optical imaging;Acoustics","autonomous underwater vehicles;light transmission;modems;optical fibre telemetry;underwater optical wireless communication","mobile platform;AUV Sentry;seafloor CORK observatory node;shiptime;submersible Alvin program;autonomous underwater vehicle;OTS;remote data offload;ROV Jason;northeast Pacific;CORK 1025C;CORK 857D;seafloor CORK borehole;optical modem;seafloor node;optical telemetry system;seafloor instrument;ROV Jason;wireless optical transmission;Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution;optical communication;ship of opportunity;subsea node;wireless data harvesting","","","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the experiments, two parsers that deliver n-best readings are included: (1) a generic deep-linguistic parser (PET) with a largely hand-crafted head-driven phrase structure grammar for English (ERG); (2) a generic statistical parser (Stanford Parser) trained on the Penn Treebank. It will be shown how the estimated confidence of RE rules learned from the n-best parses can be exploited for parse reranking for both parsers. The acquired reranking model improves the performance of RE in both training and test phases with the new first parses. The obtained significant boost of recall does not come from an overall gain in parsing performance but from an application-driven selection of parses that are best suited for the RE task. Since the readings best suited for the successful extraction of rules and instances are often not the readings favoured by a regular parser evaluation, generic parsing accuracy actually decreases. The novel method for task-specific parse reranking does not require any annotated data beyond the semantic seed, which is needed anyway for the RE task.","","","10.1093/logcom/exs055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8200098","","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The first way is the most impressive. I remember well a professor who could answer almost any question immediately.

In the early 80s, the need for interactions among companies and their trading partners led to the development of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which for many years has been the most dependable way for companies to exchange B2B documents. However the deep learning curve and the cost of the required resources to support EDI prevented Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to adopt the technology in the automated trading processes. ebXML was introduced to overcome the excising shortcomings of EDI, but has its own limitations mainly reflected in its capability in providing decision support analysis and large scale concurrent applications. In this paper, a distributed user centric B2B gateway approach is presented to support trading partners. The gateway takes the leverages of services innovation integrating resources from traditional e-business environments with loosely coupled decision support resources to complete trading intelligently.

However, AUVs have various problems which should be solved for motion control, acquisition of sensors' information, behavioral decision, navigation without collision, self-localization and so on. In order to realize the useful and practical robots which can work in the ocean, underwater vehicles should take their action by judging the changing condition from their own sensors and actuators, and are desirable to make their behaviors with limited efforts of the operators, because of the features caused by the working environment. Therefore, the AUVs should be autonomous and have adaptive function to their environment. AUVs have non-liner coupled dynamics in six degrees of freedom, and the changes of the equipments of robots have influence on the control system. In this paper, a new control system for AUVs using modular network SOM (mnSOM) proposed by Tokunaga et al. is described. The mnSOM is an extension of the conventional SOM in which each vector unit is replaced by function modules such as NN and SOM, and has both characteristic of NN (supervised learning, non-linear mapping, etc.) and SOM (interpolation, topology preservation, etc.). The proposed system has two maps (forward model map and controller map) using recurrent type NN mnSOM. A forward model map (FMM) expresses the relationship between control force and states variables, and is used to estimate a current dynamics of an AUV. A controller map (CM) expresses suitable controllers corresponding to the FMM. The efficiency of the system is investigated through the simulations and experiments.","","","10.1109/UT.2007.370774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4231104","","Decision making;Neural networks;Underwater vehicles;Oceans;Vehicle dynamics;Control systems;Force control;Motion control;Navigation;Robot sensing systems","control engineering computing;mobile robots;neural nets;self-organising feature maps;telerobotics;underwater vehicles","self-organizing decision-making system;AUV;Autonomous underwater vehicles;motion control;behavioral decision;underwater vehicles;non-liner coupled dynamics;robots;modular network SOM;forward model map;controller map;recurrent type NN","","3","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These APIs expose informational services on the Web and take many forms of remote invocation of functions using standard Web protocols and XML for data representations, e.g., REST, SOAP/WSDL, XML-RPC, and other approaches. The services (or APIs) are also usually accompanied by user facing Web applications for human-consumption. Canonical examples are Google Maps, Yahoo! Flykr and del.icio.us, EVDB's Eventful's application and API, Amazon.com's S3, ECS, Alexa, and many others. The Ruby programming language and its Rails framework are ideal for programming Web applications and services in the Web 2.0. Ruby's modern and dynamic features make it an excellent language for rapid prototyping and integration of various Web services. Rails' superb support for rapid Web application development, database access, and AJAX, make it well suited for creating front-ends and back-ends to the next generation of Web applications and services. In this tutorial we will take a hands-on deep-dive into the Ruby and Rails platform and learn how they can be used to: (1) create Web applications backed by a relational database, (2) consume Web services, (3) create and deploy APIs or Web services, and (4) mashup of existing Web services and applications.

While a lot of attention has been paid to the yield of the digital block, the yield for RF deices is relatively unexplored and yet is critical in the overall yield of a chip or a package. Today, with deep-submicron technology, yield learning becomes the most critical element for ramping to high volume production and achieving an acceptable profit margin. Collecting early production data and getting more out of test is a very important task to quickly improve yield. RF devices are known to be sensitive to local and global process variation therefore optimization for performance and yield early in the design flow is the only way to avoid design re-spins and to reduce the cost.

This yields several useful insights. It defines a proper probabilistic model for the denoising autoencoder technique, which makes it in principle possible to sample from them or rank examples by their energy. It suggests a different way to apply score matching that is related to learning to denoise and does not require computing second derivatives. It justifies the use of tied weights between the encoder and decoder and suggests ways to extend the success of denoising autoencoders to a larger family of energy-based models.","","","10.1162/NECO_a_00142","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6795935","","","","","","25","","","","","","MITP",""

"Manipulation of consonants in natural speech","J. Allen; F. Li","Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA; Beckman Institute, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, USA","2009 IEEE Workshop on Automatic Speech Recognition & Understanding","","2009","","","24","24","Summary form only given - Starting in the 1920s, researchers at AT&T Research characterized speech perception. Until 1950, this work was done by a large group working under Harvey Fletcher, which resulted in the articulation index, an important tool able to predict average speech scores. In the 1950s a dedicated group of researchers at Haskins Labs in NYC attempted to extend these ideas, and then again at MIT under the direction of Ken Stevens, further work was done, on trying to identify the reliable speech cues. Most of this work after 1950 was not successful in finding speech cues, therefore today many consider it impossible. That is, many believe that there is no direct unique mapping from the time-frequency plane to consonant and vowel recognition. For example it has been claimed that context is necessary to successfully identify nonsense consonantvowels. In fact this is not the case. The post 1950 work mostly used synthetic speech. This was a major flaw with all these studies. Also only average results were studied, again a major flaw.In 2007 we carefully measured the consonant error for 20 talkers speaking 16 different consonants, in two types of variable noise. For many consonants, the human performance is well above chance at -20 dB SNR, and at 0 dB SNR, the score is close to 100% for most sounds. The error patterns for individual sounds are quite different from the average. Vowels preform very differently than consonants. The lesson learned is to carefully study token inhomogeneity. The present work is a natural extension of these 1950 studies, but this time we have been successful and have determined the mapping. Using (1) extensive psychoacoustic methods, (2) working with a large data-base (3) of recorded speech sounds, with (4) the newly developed techniques that (5) use a model of the auditory system to (6) predict audible cues in noise, all (7) with a large number of listeners to evaluate the induced confusions, we have precisely identified the acoustic cues for individual utterances and for a large number of consonants. This paper explores the potential use of this new knowledge about perceptual cues of consonant sounds in speech processing. These cues provide deep insight into why Fletcher's articulation index is successful in predicting average ""nonsense"" speech syllables. Our analysis of a large number of nonsense Consonant-Vowel syllables from the LDC database reveals that natural speech, especially stop consonants, often contain conflicting speech cues that are characteristic of confusable sounds. Through the manipulation of these acoustic cues, one phone (a consonant or vowel sound) is be morphed into another. Meaningful sentences can be morphed into nonsense, or a sentence with a very different meaning. The resulting morphed speech is naturalsounding human speech. These techniques are robust to noise: a weak sound, easily masked by noise, can be converted into a strong one. Results of speech perception experiments on feature-enhanced /ka/ and /ga/ show that any modification of speech cues significantly changes, and can even improve the score in noise, for both normal and hearing-impaired listeners. The implications for ASR will be discussed.","","","10.1109/ASRU.2009.5373532","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5373532","","Natural languages;Acoustic noise;Speech enhancement;Speech analysis;Humans;Signal to noise ratio;Time frequency analysis;Speech recognition;Noise measurement;Preforms","speech processing","consonants manipulation;speech perception;natural speech;speech processing;Fletcher articulation index","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the 2006 DAC conference doing a much-needed ""deep dive"" into how the semiconductor industry meets technical challenges, Joe Costello, Chairman of Orb Networks, Inc., will turn the spotlight away from technology and onto today's macro consumer trends. During this session, Joe challenges participants with this fundamental question: are you going in the right direction? As you bend your minds with the complexity of implementing modem day systems and chips, are you racing toward the right finish line? What are consumers really looking for? What will convergence really lead to and are you positioned to take advantage of all it will bring our industry and our world? Join Joe as he reveals lessons learned and offers a simple view of the future of electronics.","","","10.1109/DAC.2006.238672","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1688740","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Time-slicing: a model for cerebellar function based on synchronization, reverberation, and time windows","W. M. Kistler; J. L. van Hemmen","Dept. of Phys., Tech. Univ. Munchen, Germany; NA","1999 Ninth International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks ICANN 99. (Conf. Publ. No. 470)","","1999","2","","539","544 vol.2","We present a new theory of cerebellar function that is based on synchronization, delayed reverberation, and time windows for triggering spikes. We show that granule cells admit messy fiber activity to the parallel fibers only if the Golgi cells are firing synchronously and if the spikes arrive within short and well-defined time windows. The time window mechanism organizes neuronal activity in discrete 'time slices' that can be used to discern meaningful information from background noise. In particular, Purkinje cell activity can trigger rebound spikes in deep cerebellar nuclei cells which project via brain stem nuclei and messy fibers back to the cerebellar cortex. Large network simulations reveal that a form of synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber/Purkinje cell synapses that relies on the timing of parallel and climbing fiber spikes allows the system to learn, store, and recall spatio-temporal patterns of spike activity. The present theory sheds new light on several experimental observations such as the high degree of climbing fiber spike synchrony, the width of micro zones, and developmental changes in inhibitory postsynaptic currents of granule cells.","","","10.1049/cp:19991165","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=817985","","","neurophysiology","cerebellar function;synchronization;reverberation;time windows;Golgi cells;time slices;Purkinje cell;cerebellar cortex;neurophysiology;granule cells;synaptic plasticity;spike activity;neural nets","","","","","","","","IET","IET Conferences"
"Shallow-water messenger-line recovery system","A. J. Williams; A. T. Morrison","Woods Hole Oceanogr. Instn., MA, USA; NA","OCEANS 96 MTS/IEEE Conference Proceedings. The Coastal Ocean - Prospects for the 21st Century","","1996","2","","646","649 vol.2","Shelf and estuarine deployments of bottom mounted instruments generally require complete recovery of the instrument, including anchors. Subsurface instruments may have lift lines for recovery, often on acoustically commanded release of a float. The lift line and float are large for heavy instruments and this creates a flow disturbance that distorts the environment being measured. When redundancy in recovery lines is added, the volume of lines and floats may become unacceptable. Light weight messenger lines with small messenger floats are less flow disturbing and can be added to provide redundancy with less compromise to the measurement. A set of four messenger lines with floats was used in the Hudson River in 1995 to recover a massive quadrapod deployed on the bottom for several weeks. The messenger lines, with ample scope, were used to pull, by hand, one end of a short, strong lift line to the surface for recovery of the quadrapod. In this deployment, each messenger line went to an independent lift line, but several messenger lines could be joined to a single lift line. Redundancy is needed for the most vulnerable elements of a system and in shallow water this is the lift line itself. In deeper water, the extra complexity of connecting several messenger lines to a single lift line is offset by the substantial savings in volume by eliminating a redundant lift line. Experience in two recoveries with this recovery system shows that the burnwire used to release the messenger line float works very well but can become fatigued in shipping, line fouling can trap the float in the launch silo, and floats can rise but fail to surface in strong current because Froude drag increases near the surface. The authors have yet to learn if biofouling and heavy sediment deposition are a problem The benefit of redundancy has been noted in numerous other experiments where loss occurred when lift lines were cut by propellers, bilge keels, and guard buoys, and when tangles prevented a float from coming all the way to the surface. The benefit of small, low drag messenger lines would have been substantial in deployments in deep, high current regimes where a scope of two to one made the lift line package quite large. Four independent messenger line recovery packages took less space than the single primary lift line system that it replaced.","","","10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568303","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=568303","","Instruments;Distortion measurement;Fluid flow measurement;Packaging;Acoustic distortion;Acoustic measurements;Rivers;Joining processes;Sediments;Propellers","geophysical equipment;oceanographic equipment","seafloor deployed instrument;ocean equipment;shallow-water messenger-line recovery system;geophysical apparatus;estuarine deployment;bottom mounted instrument;messenger float;massive quadrapod;underwater structure","","4","2","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is thought to “gate” the flow of a diverse range of information (e.g., rewarding, aversive, and novel events) from limbic afferents to basal ganglia outputs. Gating and information encoding may be achieved via cross-frequency coupling, in which bursts of high-frequency activity occur preferentially during specific phases of slower oscillations. We examined whether the human nucleus accumbens engages such a mechanism by recording electrophysiological activity directly from the accumbens of human patients undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Oscillatory activity in the gamma (40–80 Hz) frequency range was synchronized with the phase of simultaneous alpha (8–12 Hz) waves. Further, losing and winning small amounts of money elicited relatively increased gamma oscillation power prior to and following alpha troughs, respectively. Gamma–alpha synchronization may reflect an electrophysiological gating mechanism in the human nucleus accumbens, and the phase differences in gamma–alpha coupling may reflect a reward information coding scheme similar to phase coding.","","","10.1162/jocn.2009.21062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6793630","","","","","","3","","","","","","MITP",""

Network traffic processing speed is crucial in most of network devices, because any packet drop can lead to lower quality of network services, affect precise monitoring or disallow detection of security threats. General purpose processors are not able to process all data on high-speed network links. For 100 Gb lines, packet can arrive every 5 ns. Therefore network devices use hardware acceleration to speed up time-critical operations. In this tutorial, we will introduce these time-critical operations together with hardware architectures, which are able to achieve 10, 40 or even 100 Gbps throughput. In particular, the tutorial deals with parsing of packet headers, longest prefix matching (IP look-up), packet classification and regular expression matching. All these operations are widely used in network security and monitoring devices and have to be accelerated to achieve 100 Gb throughput. We will present that deep pipelines, perfect hashing and efficient utilization of on-chip memory can help to achieve high throughput or decrease hardware resources. The end of the presentation will be devoted to the rapid development of hardware accelerated network applications for 100 Gbps networks. In summary, tutorial participants will become familiar with the state of the art algorithms and hardware architectures for high speed packet processing. They will learn how to utilize these architectures and accelerate network applications.","","","10.1109/DDECS.2013.6549780","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549780","","Tutorials","computer architecture;computer network security;telecommunication traffic","hardware acceleration;computer networks;network traffic processing speed;network devices;packet drop;network service quality reduction;security threat detection;general purpose processors;high-speed network links;time-critical operations;hardware architectures;packet headers;longest prefix matching;packet classification;regular expression matching;on-chip memory utilization;hashing;network throughput;hardware resources;high speed packet processing;bit rate 100 Gbit/s","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Block Matching enables an image patch of the probe face image to search for its best matching from displaced positions in the gallery face image. This matching strategy is very effective for handling spatial shift between two images and it is radically different from that of the widely used LBP type patch-based local matching approaches. Our evaluations on the FERET and CMU-PIE databases show that the performance of this simple method is well comparable (superior) to that of the popular LBP approach. We argue that the Block Matching could provide face recognition a new approach with more flexible algorithm architecture. One can expect that it could lead to much higher performance when combining with other feature extraction techniques, like Gabor wavelet and deep learning.","","","10.1109/ICIP.2014.7025145","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7025145","face recognition;block matching;LBP;patch-based matching","Face recognition;Face;Databases;Probes;Histograms;Feature extraction;Accuracy","face recognition;feature extraction;image matching;visual databases","block matching;face recognition;BM;image patch;probe face image;gallery face image;spatial shift handing;LBP type patch-based local matching approach;FERET databases;CMU-PIE databases;feature extraction techniques","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is authentic, rigorous, and enjoyable, making it an excellent topic for an undergraduate software engineering course. However, it is difficult to explain to the beginner how to generate a successful exploratory strategy. “Case studies” and “lessons learned” from practitioners illustrate the value of exploratory testing but do not necessarily reveal the motivation for a particular exploratory tour. Here we discuss the use of problem frames as a means of guiding students toward promising testing strategies. Problem frames were originally proposed as a requirements analysis approach, carefully locating and bounding software problems to be solved, then matching subproblems to commonly occurring problem patterns or “frames”. A natural extension to that idea is to associate test strategies with particular frame concerns, guiding the student toward exploratory techniques that are well-suited to the frame. Once students become confident exploratory testers, they can add their own strategies to a growing body of knowledge. To illustrate the approach, we consider frame concerns and test strategies for workpieces problems, using Google Calendar as our test subject.","","","10.1109/CSEET.2013.6595262","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595262","","Calendars;Google;Software testing;Software quality;Abstracts","computer aided instruction;computer science education;educational courses;formal specification;program testing","exploratory testing;problem frames;industry-adopted process;human creativity;software product;undergraduate software engineering course;requirements analysis approach;Google Calendar","","2","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a new process which achieves this goal by putting all families of descriptors one wants to consider in a pool of descriptors and by letting the algorithm build a cascade with the most efficient descriptors by introducing management of very large features pools. On the one hand, the selection of a specific family of descriptors for a given application implies a deep experience of the operator on the algorithm behaviour. On the other hand, physical constraints such as computer time and memory requirements prevent us from using all available descriptors. We present here a solution which considers several families of descriptors as a pool of descriptors and builds a cascade with the most efficient descriptors. The idea developed here consists in beginning to build a cascade with one type of descriptors and then introducing new kinds of descriptors when the current descriptor family does not bring enough differentiating information anymore. In this scope, four families of descriptors are studied here: Histogram Distance on Haar Region (HDHR), Edge Orientation Histograms (EOH), Histogram Orientation Gradient (HOG) and Gabor filters. Evaluation on public data sets shows the importance of complementary features, since performances of state of the art methods are improved.","","","10.1109/ICIP.2009.5414315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5414315","Boosting;object detection;mining features","Object detection;Histograms;Image edge detection;Computer vision;Face detection;Technological innovation;Detectors;Application software;Physics computing;Gabor filters","edge detection;Gabor filters;gradient methods;Haar transforms;object detection","object detection;visual attributes;algorithm behaviour;physical constraints;descriptors;histogram distance on Haar region;edge orientation histograms;histogram orientation gradient;Gabor filters","","1","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper takes a practical look at the challenges and rewards of experienced engineers and educators becoming mentors for students or young practicing engineers. The author recommends an approach to mentoring that is deep in self-evaluation, one that considers the intellectual, social, cultural, and professional development needs of students and young professionals, and the need for taking little steps-one person at a time-that may make a big difference in student's performance and attitudes towards learning. It is argued that such an approach to mentoring will help encourage more underrepresented groups, such as women and minorities, to pursue careers in engineering.

In this study, we use feedforward neural networks to evaluate the impact of structural variations on the ability of a network to learn and retain representations of external information. Performance is evaluated by statistically analyzing the error in the representations produced by parallel and layered networks during supervised, sequential function approximation. By varying the initial network state and the time given to learn the information, we identify tradeoffs between configurations that optimize for the best versus worst case scenarios and for the production of accurate versus retainable and generalizable representations of information. We show that these tradeoffs are maintained in larger networks and for variations in the information presented to the networks. By characterizing the curvature, depth, and participation of network connections about local error landscape minima, we find that variations in landscape structure give rise to the observed tradeoffs in performance. Consistently deep, narrow minima enable parallel networks to produce highly accurate solutions at the cost of more frequent failure in retention and generalizability. In contrast, variability in the depth and curvature of local minima enables layered networks to produce coarse but generalizable solutions at the cost of hindering consistent accuracy. Identifying structural drivers of functional performance is crucial for understanding both successes and limitations of information processing systems.","","","10.1109/ACSSC.2011.6190125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6190125","","Training;Biological neural networks;Information processing;Optimization;Navigation;Neodymium","feedforward neural nets;function approximation;medical computing;parallel processing;statistical analysis","information processing network;structural configuration drives functionality;natural information processing system;artificial information processing system;feedforward neural network;structural variation;external information;statistical analysis;parallel network;layered network;sequential function approximation;curvature;network connection;local error landscape minima;landscape structure","","","24","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Word2vec is a tool, which establishes the neural network models to learn the vector representations of words in the high dimensional vector space. So it can extract the deep semantic relationships between words. In this paper, firstly, we cluster the similar features together using word2vec. And then we use word2vec again to learn the word representations as candidate feature vectors. After feature selection, the SVMperf package is adopted to train and classify the comment texts.

The advantage of the proposed unified view is first to describe the different underdetermined source separation problems as particular cases of a more general framework. Second, it provides a flexible means to include a variety of prior information concerning the sources such as smoothness, local stationarity or periodicity through the use of adequate covariance functions. Third, given the model, it provides an optimal solution in the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) sense to the source separation problem. In order to make the GP models tractable for very large signals, we introduce framing as a GP approximation and we show that computations for regularly sampled and locally stationary GPs can be done very efficiently in the frequency domain.

These games rely on a constructivist approach to learning, where the learner constructs knowledge through concrete experiences. Endogenous educational games which are specifically developed for educational purposes mostly make this purpose explicit: they make it clear in advance what is about to be learned. This research tried to find out how such an explicit purpose influences the game behavior and comprehension by developing two versions of an endogenous educational game about over fishing, one with and one without an explicit purpose. It showed that children who played the explicit version got more shallow knowledge and showed more active game behavior. The players who showed more explorative game behavior acquired more deep knowledge about the game.","","","10.1109/CW.2011.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6079355","educational games;endogenous games;exogenous games;game design;game experience","Games;Marine animals;Ecosystems;Boats;Weapons;Computers;Context","computer aided instruction;computer games","game behavior;educational computer game;game play mechanics;endogenous educational game","","2","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper is based on a collection of lessons-learned based on related missions including StarLight, a formation-flying stellar interferometry mission that merged with the Terrestrial Planet Finder technology development program just prior to entering phase C/D, the Space Interferometry Mission (currently in phase B), and the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (a radar interferometer which flew in 2000). In first order, optical interferometry missions differ from classical deep-space science missions in several key respects: they are highly distributed systems, they are sensitive to small, cross-coupling error sources, and their operation is very complex. This leads to three unique system engineering challenges associated with implementing such missions: error handling and performance modeling, validation and verification (V&V), and system robustness. With an upcoming suite of interferometry missions approaching the transition from technology-development mode to flight project implementation mode the time is ripe for a discussion of these challenges and proposed solutions.","","","10.1109/AERO.2004.1368006","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1368006","","Systems engineering and theory;Optical interferometry;Interferometers;Spaceborne radar;Space technology;Optical sensors;Planets;Space missions;Space shuttles;Surfaces","systems engineering;aerospace instrumentation;light interferometers;error handling;astronomical telescopes","system engineering;spaceborne optical interferometers;space interferometry mission;flying stellar interferometry mission;Terrestrial Planet Finder technology program;Shuttle Radar Topography Mission;radar interferometer;cross coupling error sources;error handling;performance modeling;system robustness;flight project implementation mode;technology-development mode","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our experimental evaluations show that our learned scene structures outperform state-of-the-art method of Deformable Part Models in detecting objects in a scene.

The main obstacle for the wider exploration of this methodology lies in the need for large annotated training sets, which are used for the estimation of the statistical model parameters. In this paper, we present a new on-line co-training methodologythat reduces the need for large training sets for such parameter estimation. Our approach learns the initial parameters of two different models using a small manually annotated training set. Then, given each frame of a test sequence, the methodology not only produces the segmentation of the current frame, but it also uses the results of both classifiers to retrain each other incrementally. This on-line aspect of our approach has the advantages of producing segmentation results and retraining the classifiers on the fly as frames of a test sequence are presented, but it introduces a harder learning setting compared to the usual off-line co-training, where the algorithm has access to the whole set of un-annotated training samples from the beginning. Moreover, we introduce the use of the following new types of classifiers in the co-training framework: deep belief network and multiple model probabilistic data association. We show that our method leads to a fully automatic left ventricle segmentation system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a public database with training sets containing at least twenty annotated images.","","","10.1109/CVPR.2012.6247770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6247770","","Training;Image segmentation;Pattern recognition;Probabilistic logic;Ultrasonic imaging;Data models;Vectors","image segmentation;medical image processing;pattern recognition","training set size;pattern recognition method;statistical pattern recognition model;ultrasound image;annotated training set;statistical model parameter;online co-training methodology;parameter estimation;test sequence;offline co-training;un-annotated training sample;belief network;multiple model probabilistic data association;automatic left ventricle segmentation system;public database;training sets;annotated image","","6","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many attempts have been made to optimize the control of HVAC systems by minimizing the energy wasted in conditioning buildings that are unoccupied. Systems have been proposed that turn off HVAC systems when a house is unoccupied, or put the system into an energy saving deep-setback mode when the occupants are asleep. An area that has not been as well explored is the retrofitting of centralized HVAC systems to save energy when the residents are at home and awake. In this paper, we demonstrate how to use cheap, off-the-shelf sensors and actuators to retrofit a centralized HVAC system and enable rooms to be heated or cooled individually, in order to reduce waste caused by conditioning unoccupied rooms. We call this approach room-level zoning. Sensors are used to detect occupancy in rooms which allows the learning of occupancy patterns and prediction of room occupancy. Unoccupied rooms can be allowed to drift away from a user defined comfortable temperature if they are less likely to be used in the near future while occupied rooms are maintained at a comfortable temperature. We implement room-level zoning in a 1400 square foot house by retrofitting an existing centralized HVAC system with wireless temperature sensors to monitor room-level temperature, motion sensors to monitor occupancy, and wirelessly actuatable dampers to control the flow of conditioned air through the house. Initial analysis indicates that this method has a 20.5% energy savings over the existing single-zoned thermostat.","","","10.1109/IGCC.2012.6322269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6322269","Building energy;wireless sensor networks;sensing","Temperature sensors;Heating;Buildings;Registers;Ducts","energy conservation;HVAC;maintenance engineering;thermostats","centralized HVAC systems retrofitting;room-level zoning;heating ventilation and cooling;building energy usage;off-the-shelf sensors;comfortable temperature;wirelessly actuatable dampers;energy savings;single-zoned thermostat","","5","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Meanwhile, automated spoken language processing systems have begun to emerge in commercial applications, not as a result of any deep insights into the way in which humans process language, but largely as a consequence of the introduction of a 'data-driven' approach to building practical systems. At the same time, computational models of human spoken language processing have begun to emerge but, although this has given rise to a greater interest in the relationship between human and machine behavior, the performance of the best models appears to be asymptoting some way short of the capabilities of the human listener/speaker. This paper discusses these issues, and presents an argument in favor of the derivation of a 'unifying theory' that would be capable of explaining and predicting both human and machine spoken language processing behavior, and hence serve both communities as well as representing a long-term 'grand challenge' for the scientific community in the emerging field of 'cognitive informatics'.","","","10.1109/COGINF.2005.1532629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1532629","","Natural languages;Humans;Automatic speech recognition;Computer science;Organisms;Psychoacoustic models;Psychology;Acoustical engineering;Speech processing;Auditory system","speech processing;natural languages","automated spoken language processing systems;human spoken language processing;machine spoken language processing;cognitive informatics","","8","52","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The aim of this work is to verify the reproducibility of the subjective evaluation of the expert on the basis of a decision support system (DSS) that automatically and objectively reproduces MAC diagnosis. A set of 61 patients with suspected clinical diagnosis for lung cancer has been taken into account. The scientist who first described MAC defined each patient as MAC positive or negative on the basis of the MAC diagnosis performed on all cells of the related cytologic sample. A DSS based on an artificial neural network has been set up to learn the relation between 14 morphometric and texture parameters, computed on each nucleus by image processing techniques, with the MAC diagnosis of the expert on each cell. The results show that an objective automatic assessment on MAC by the DSS can effectively support the MAC diagnosis.

Twenty-five participants were instructed to navigate to distinct landmark buildings in a previously learned virtual reality town environment. Data from periods of navigation between landmarks were subject to BSS analyses to obtain source components. Two of these cortical sources were found to exhibit significant spectral power differences during navigation with respect to a resting eyes open condition and were subject to source localization using sLORETA. These two sources were localized as a right parietal component with gamma activation and a right medial-temporal–parietal component with activation in theta and gamma bandwidths. The parietal gamma activity was thought to reflect visuospatial processing associated with the task. The medial-temporal–parietal activity was thought to be more specific to the navigational processing, representing the integration of ego- and allo-centric representations of space required for successful navigation, suggesting theta and gamma oscillations may have a role in integrating information from parietal and medial-temporal regions. Theta activity on this medial-temporal–parietal source was positively correlated with more efficient navigation performance. Results are discussed in light of the depth and proposed closed field structure of the hippocampus and potential implications for scalp EEG data. The findings of the present study suggest that appropriate BSS methods are ideally suited to minimizing the effects of volume conduction in noninvasive recordings, allowing more accurate exploration of deep brain processes.","","","10.1162/jocn_a_00098","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6794628","","","","","","1","","","","","","MITP",""

Most systems are large and employ some form of beam scanning to achieve a video rate (20Hz) image. We will explore what technical developments are required to make a truly portable imaging device (similar to currently available thermal imagining cameras). A contributing cause to disease is known to be due to mis-folding of proteins. But how proteins fold in order to perform a biological task is a deep mystery.

Electrical engineers offer biologists means for understanding their molecular systems as equivalent electrical circuits. Standard, powerful, circuit-solver, commercial software can therefore be then used to 'solve' these circuits in order to truly and directly give mechanical interpretation of molecular bond behaviour.

When even their own management team casts an ominous eye in their direction every time the notion of budget cuts and subsequent layoffs loom large, the writing community could easily be justified for having a sense of paranoia that their perceived value-add to the development effort of new products is significantly less than that of their code-crunching counterparts in the next aisle. This work attempts to dispel some of that angst by sharing one technical communicator's experience in facing self doubt head-on, in diving into the deep end of the developer pool early in the project cycle, finding ways to contribute to the design and development effort, and to provide real value as an active member of the project team. As a result, a strong and mutually respectful relationship between technical communicators and programmers has been established, with programmers learning to seek out the technical communicator's advice on GUI design and usability, message formats and standard usage of terminology, and actually listening to (and in many cases implementing!) suggested ideas from their dedicated writing team.","","","10.1109/IPCC.2004.1375277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1375277","","Programming profession;Writing;Engineering profession;Product development;Usability;Scheduling;Stomach;Eyes;Financial management;Graphical user interfaces","ergonomics;professional aspects;graphical user interfaces;project management;human factors;team working","development myth;technical communicators;second class citizens;development community;writing community;project cycle;project team;technical programmers;GUI design;GUI usability;message formats;terminology usage;workplace issues;professional development;cross-skill teams","","1","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Bridle","NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","","2010","404","1","458","467","Gravitational lensing shear has the potential to be the most powerful tool for constraining the nature of dark energy. However, accurate measurement of galaxy shear is crucial and has been shown to be non-trivial by the Shear TEsting Programme. Here, we demonstrate a fundamental limit to the accuracy achievable by model-fitting techniques, if oversimplistic models are used. We show that even if galaxies have elliptical isophotes, model-fitting methods which assume elliptical isophotes can have significant biases if they use the wrong profile. We use noise-free simulations to show that on allowing sufficient flexibility in the profile the biases can be made negligible. This is no longer the case if elliptical isophote models are used to fit galaxies made up of a bulge plus a disc, if these two components have different ellipticities. The limiting accuracy is dependent on the galaxy shape, but we find the most significant biases (∼1 per cent of the shear) for simple spiral-like galaxies. The implications for a given cosmic shear survey will depend on the actual distribution of galaxy morphologies in the Universe, taking into account the survey selection function and the point spread function. However, our results suggest that the impact on cosmic shear results from current and near future surveys may be negligible. Meanwhile, these results should encourage the development of existing approaches which are less sensitive to morphology, as well as methods which use priors on galaxy shapes learnt from deep surveys.","","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16300.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8223848","gravitational lensing;methods: data analysis;cosmology: observations","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The practical way to study the TCP performance is by simulating on a dumbbell topology, Internet statistically equivalent cross-traffic along with simulated TCP, then extracting interest variables such as throughput as the indicator of performance. However, we advocate that much more can be learned about TCP performance by regenerating path characteristic conditions derived from traces, and let TCP flows run loose on top of it. In this study, we investigate several Internet public TCP flows, using LAN-specific traces (Berkeley LBNL (races), and we show how path characteristics can be extracted. We devise a new technique to obtain path capacity by searching longitudinal patterns of packet pairs on each TCP flow present in a trace. In addition, we look on buffer usage patterns based on effective throughput/estimated capacity ratio, as a way to relate KTT variation, packet loss and disclosure buffer sizes. Finally, the natural application is to test advanced TCP proposals on a per-trace scenario basis by regenerating dynamic traffic patterns directly from stored traces, such method is also called source-based traffic pattern. In this trace regeneration testbed, we have as input the TCP trace, then, a post-processing mechanism inferring path characteristics per flow.

Brunner","NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","","2013","432","2","1483","1501","With the growth of large photometric surveys, accurately estimating photometric redshifts, preferably as a probability density function (PDF), and fully understanding the implicit systematic uncertainties in this process, has become increasingly important. In this paper, we present a new, publicly available, parallel, machine learning algorithm that generates photometric redshift PDFs by using prediction trees and random forest techniques, which we have named TPZ.1 This new algorithm incorporates measurement errors into the calculation while also dealing efficiently with missing values in the data. In addition, our implementation of this algorithm provides supplementary information regarding the data being analysed, including unbiased estimates of the accuracy of the technique without resorting to a validation data set, identification of poor photometric redshift areas within the parameter space occupied by the spectroscopic training data, a quantification of the relative importance of the variables used to construct the PDF, and a robust identification of outliers. This extra information can be used to optimally target new spectroscopic observations and to improve the overall efficacy of the redshift estimation. We have tested TPZ on galaxy samples drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main galaxy sample and from the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe-2 (DEEP2) survey, obtaining excellent results in each case. We also have tested our implementation by participating in the PHAT1 project, which is a blind photometric redshift contest, finding that TPZ performs comparable to if not better than other empirical photometric redshift algorithms. Finally, we discuss the various parameters that control the operation of TPZ, the specific limitations of this approach and an application of photometric redshift PDFs.","","","10.1093/mnras/stt574","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8185212","methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;surveys;galaxies: distances and redshift;galaxies: statistics","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

One aspect of this investigation involves identifying galaxies with disturbed morphologies (e.g. merging galaxies). This is often done by summarizing galaxy images using, e.g. the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness and Gini-M20 statistics of Conselice and Lotz et al., respectively, and associating particular statistic values with disturbance. We introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbed morphologies at high redshift (z ∼ 2): the multimode (M), intensity (I) and deviation (D) statistics. We show their effectiveness by training a machine-learning classifier, random forest, using 1639 galaxies observed in the H band by the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3, galaxies that had been previously classified by eye by the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration. We find that the MID statistics (and the A statistic of Conselice) are the most useful for identifying disturbed morphologies. We also explore whether human annotators are useful for identifying disturbed morphologies. We demonstrate that they show limited ability to detect disturbance at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyond ≈10 does not provably yield better classification performance. We propose a simulation-based model-fitting algorithm that mitigates these issues by bypassing annotation.","","","10.1093/mnras/stt1016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8182439","methods: data analysis;methods: statistical;galaxies: evolution;galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: high-redshift;galaxies: statistics;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

During EDL, the spacecraft's orientation is determined by its guidance and mechanical subsystems to ensure that the vehicle land safely at its destination. Although orientation to maximize telecom performance is not possible, antennas are especially designed and mounted to provide the best possible line of sight to Earth and to the Mars orbiters supporting MSL's landing. The tones and data transmitted over these links are selected carefully to reflect the most essential parameters of the vehicle's state and the performance of the EDL subsystems for post-EDL reconstruction should no further data transmission from the vehicle be possible. This paper addresses the configuration of the X band receive system used at NASA / JPL's Deep Space Network (DSN) to capture the signal spectrum of MSL's X band carrier and tone signal, examines the MSL vehicle state information obtained from the X band carrier signal only and contrasts the Doppler-derived information against the post-EDL known vehicle state. The paper begins with a description of the MSL EDL sequence of events and discusses the impact of the EDL maneuvers such as guided entry, parachute deploy, and powered descent on the frequency observables expected at the DSN. The range of Doppler dynamics possible is derived from extensive 6 Degrees-Of-Freedom (6 DOF) vehicle state calculations performed by MSL's EDL simulation team. The configuration of the DSN's receive system, using the Radio Science Receivers (RSR) to perform open-loop recording for both for nominal and off-nominal EDL scenarios, is detailed. Expected signal carrier power-to-noise levels during EDL are shown and their impact on signal detection is considered. Particular attention is given to the selection of the appropriate RSR processing bandwidths and to its configuration for real-time signal detection. The X-band carrier frequency obtained through post-processing of the open-loop recorded spectrum is given. Detection of spacecraft status and completion of key vehicle events through their Doppler signature is discussed and illustrated. This Doppler-derived information is compared against the very accurate vehicle data obtained post-EDL via MSL's UHF radio subsystem. The paper concludes with a discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of transmitting the X-band carrier and tone signal in the general context of EDL communications and lessons learned for future missions with EDL sequences are given.","","","10.1109/AERO.2013.6497418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6497418","","Space vehicles;Earth;Mars;Telecommunications;Real-time systems;Receivers","","","","1","8","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To reach optimal performance in such systems, deep understanding and expertise of each component is necessary, thus limiting the development of ASR systems to skilled experts. To overcome the problem, this paper studies the use of black box optimization, which automatically tunes systems without any prior knowledge. We consider an ASR system as a function with tuning parameters as input and speech recognition performance (e.g., word accuracy) as output, and we investigate two probabilistic black box optimization techniques: Covariance Mean Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and Bayesian optimization using Gaussian process.

Big visible charts display testing for co-located teams in a particularly effective form. Testers experiment with a variety of big visible representations throughout the life of the team, retaining these charts only as long as they provide value for decision-making and moving on to other forms as the team learns more about satisfying their information-gathering needs through testing.

Realsearch is an issue-focused, principle-based methodology that first defines the nature of a problem before considering solutions. Solutions are then analyzed or designed according to a set of fundamental design principles. Insight is fostered with this cause-and-effect understanding, and communicated within an organization through means of a local metaphor model-which provides a graphic depiction of this cause-and-effect relationship for a known and respected local business practice. One immediately practical application is for directing business process reengineering projects. Another is the capture and mobilization of corporate core competency knowledge. A third important application is in what we now call continuing education-at all employee levels. Insight provides a very different leverage over simple procedural learning and training. Formal education traditionally gives us new rules to employ, training traditionally gives us experience in applying those rules, workshops focus us (sometimes) on real and practical problems, and seminars expose us to someone else's thoughts.

We compare the properties of HDF 130 with the new and important constraint of the upper limit of the radio flux density at 240 MHz to an analytic model. We learn what values of physical parameters in the model for the dynamics and evolution of the radio luminosity and X-ray luminosity [due to IC scattering of the cosmic microwave background (CMB)] of a Fanaroff–Riley type II (FR II) source are able to describe a source with features (lobe length, axial ratio, X-ray luminosity, photon index and upper limit of radio luminosity) similar to those of the observations. HDF 130 is found to agree with the interpretation that it is an IC ghost of a powerful double-lobed radio source, and we are observing it at least a few Myr after jet activity (which lasted 5–100 Myr) has ceased. The minimum Lorentz factor of injected particles into the lobes from the hotspot is preferred to be γ∼ 103 for the model to describe the observed quantities well, assuming that the magnetic energy density, electron energy density and lobe pressure at time of injection into the lobe are linked by constant factors according to a minimum energy argument, so that the minimum Lorentz factor is constrained by the lobe pressure. We also apply the model to match the features of 6C 0905+3955, a classical double FR II galaxy thought to have a low-energy cut-off of γ∼ 104 in the hotspot due to a lack of hotspot IC X-ray emission. The models suggest that the low-energy cut-off in the hotspots of 6C 0905+3955 is γ≳ 103, just slightly above the particles required for X-ray emission.","","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19374.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8195198","galaxies: evolution;galaxies: individual: RG J123617/HDF 130;galaxies: individual: 6C 0905+3955;galaxies: jets;radio continuum: galaxies;X-rays: galaxies","","","","","","","","","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

We propose a hierarchial dynamic framework that first extracts high level skeletal joints features and then uses the learned representation for estimating emission probability to infer action sequences. Currently gaussian mixture models are the dominant technique for modeling the emission distribution of hidden Markov models. We show that better action recognition using skeletal features can be achieved by replacing gaussian mixture models by deep neural networks that contain many layers of features to predict probability distributions over states of hidden Markov models.

If the Primary User (PU) signal experiences deep fading or blocked by obstacles, the power of the received PU signal at the Secondary User (SU) may be too weak to be detected. If the SU transmitter cannot detect the presence of the PU transmitter while the PU receiver is within the transmission range of the SU, the transmission of the PU will be interfered. To address this problem, CSS has been shown to be an effective method to improve the detection performance by exploiting spatial diversity. In this paper, we investigate the optimality of cooperation scheme using coalitional game theory. The cognitive behavior i.e. observe, learn and act can be modelled effectively in game theory to study, model and analyze the strategic interactions among Cognitive Radio (CR) users. This paper describes the analytical insights of coalitional game theory for CSS in cognitive radio, highlighting techniques for identifying steady states, convergence and steady state optimality. We critically assess the techniques available in the literature, and then describe our ongoing work applying our insights to algorithm design for cognitive radios using Game theory.","","","10.1109/IC3I.2014.7019703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7019703","Cognitive radio;Dynamic spectrum access;Spectrum sensing;Game theory;Coalitional game","Games;Cognitive radio;Game theory;Cascading style sheets;Sensors;Steady-state","cognitive radio;cooperative communication;fading channels;game theory;multipath channels;radio receivers;radio spectrum management;radio transmitters;signal detection","cooperative spectrum sensing;cognitive radio;coalitional game theory;multipath fading;wireless channel;primary user;secondary user;SU transmitter;PU receiver;PU transmitter;CSS;spatial diversity;CR users;steady state identification","","3","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method makes use of a priori knowledge derived from a subsample of spectroscopic confirmed quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) to map the parameter space. The disentanglement of QSOs candidates and stars is performed in the colour space through the combined use of two algorithms, the probabilistic principal surfaces and the negative entropy clustering, which are for the first time used in an astronomical context. Both methods have been implemented in the voneural package on the Astrogrid Virtual Observatory platform. Even though they belong to the class of the unsupervised clustering tools, the performances of the method are optimized by using the available sample of confirmed quasars and it is therefore possible to learn from any improvement in the available ‘base of knowledge’. The method has been applied and tested on both optical and optical plus near-infrared data extracted from the visible Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and infrared United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey-Large Area Survey public data bases. In all cases, the experiments lead to high values of both efficiency and completeness, comparable if not better than the methods already known in the literature.

It is argued that, in the late twentieth century, technology, supported by developments in scientific theory, has given new efficacy to visual thinking and experience. Increasingly, illustrations of various types are employed to give meaning to otherwise incomprehensible data. Today's technical communicator must learn to deal effectively with the new demands of a visual culture, becoming not only a master of the new technology but also a possessor of a deep understanding of the theories and structures of visual knowledge.<>","","","10.1109/47.68422","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=68422","","Modems;Printing machinery;Face detection;Power engineering and energy;Pediatrics;Fellows;Mathematical model;Cultural differences;History;Natural languages","computer graphics;vision","humanities;computer graphics;scientific theory;visual thinking;data;technical communicator;visual culture;visual knowledge","","5","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spatio-navigational type of problems.","","","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974084","Embodied interaction;Bayesian modeling;Hybrid human-machine system","Cities and towns;Bayes methods;Speech;Torso;Measurement;Decision making;Navigation","behavioural sciences;belief networks;decision making;gesture recognition;utility theory","complex decision making problems;computational framework;Bayesian approach;utility theory;physical interaction modalities;feedback modalities;BAN;task performance;control modalities;spationavigational type problems;embodied interaction;Bayesian attentional network","","2","19","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the various interfaces and their applications may look different, they are all based on strikingly similar, fundamental principles of biophysics, electrochemistry and information theory, and enabled by similar microfabrication and microelectronic technologies. Neural control is gradually converging on principles of design and best practices that can and should give rise to engineering standards and interchangeable components for recurring functions such as bioelectric recording and stimulation, transmission of power and data, and physical packaging and user interfaces.

Continuous relationship with customer and customer process supports life cycle learning and knowledge catching. Whole the value network around the customer process is continuously searching balance between effectiveness and profitability over the life cycle. Business transition is difficult to execute if the networked business is not understood from system point of view through ""big picture"" of the business and if suitable collaborative performance metrics is not used. There have been many attempts to describe industrial service in the form of ""big picture"". Some of them have been too complicated, some too simple, some are biased serving only single point of view. Service excellence means understanding of the whole business picture. That system model leads us to the roots of service excellence. Service excellence can be continuously measured and followed by indicators looking from various viewpoints. Some of the indicators are based on balance scorecard key performance indicators. Some of the viewpoints are such that there have not been used any indicators. Emotional aspects or future service opportunities are not yet addressed by any indicators. Emotional factors become more and more important on service implementation. Enterprise brand image is also important in successful service marketing. By mastering innovation in open environment over customer process life cycle it is possible to achieve leadership in life cycle business transition. Innovation is taking place in three dimensions, business, customer and life cycle innovation. Innovation process over the three dimensions enables new type of business transition with lower risk level. Business co evolution is taking place on boundaries of business models, networks and deliverables. Performance metrics should align to translate vision to action and establish the criteria for business process optimization.

In this presentation, I will emphasize how LMS, portfolio development, peer evaluation between student groups, can be exploited to reach the learning goals we set for learning to perform microelectronic design.","","","10.1109/ICCES.2009.5383325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5383325","","Education;Microelectronics;Electronic learning;Least squares approximation;Educational technology;Watches;Learning systems;Portfolios;Performance evaluation;Biographies","computer aided instruction;electronic engineering education;further education;integrated circuit design;integrated circuits;learning systems;teaching","microelectronic design teaching;student active learning methods;e-learning;higher education;Web;learning management systems;portfolio development","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"The Berkeley Data Analytics Stack: Present and future","M. Franklin","UC Berkeley, USA","2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data","","2013","","","2","3","The Berkeley AMPLab was founded on the idea that the challenges of emerging Big Data applications requires a new approach to analytics systems. Launching in early 2011, the project set out to rethink the traditional analytics stack, breaking down technical and intellectual barriers that had arisen during decades of evolutionary development. The vision of the lab is to seamlessly integrate the three main resources available for making sense of data at scale: Algorithms (such as machine learning and statistical techniques), Machines (in the form of scalable clusters and elastic cloud computing), and People (both individually as analysts and en masse, as with crowdsourced human computation). To pursue this goal, we assembled a research team with diverse interests across computer science, forged relationships with domain experts on campus and elsewhere, and obtained the support of leading industry partners and major government sponsors. The lab is realizing its ideas through the development of a freely-available Open Source software stack called BDAS: the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack. In the nearly three years the lab has been in operation, we've released major components of BDAS. Several of these components have gained significant traction in industry and elsewhere: the Mesos cluster resource manager, the Spark inmemory computation framework, and the Shark query processing system. BDAS shows up prominently in many industry discussions of the future of the Big Data analytics ecosystem - a rare degree of impact for an ongoing academic project. Given this initial success, the lab is continuing on its research path, moving ""up the stack"" to better integrate and support deep machine learning and to make people a full-fledged resource for making sense of Big Data. In this talk, I'll first outline the motivation and insights behind our research approach and describe how we have organized to address the cross-disciplinary nature of Big Data challenges. I will then describe the current state of BDAS with an emphasis on the key components listed above and will address our current efforts on machine learning scalability and ease of use, and hybrid human/computer processing. Finally I will present our current views of how all the pieces will fit together to form a system that can adaptively bring the right resources to bear on a given data-driven question to meet time, cost and quality requirements throughout the analytics lifecycle.","","","10.1109/BigData.2013.6691545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6691545","","","Big Data;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence)","hybrid human-computer processing;Shark query processing system;Spark inmemory computation framework;Mesos cluster resource manager;ppen source software stack;elastic cloud computing;scalable cluster;statistical technique;machine learning;evolutionary development;Berkeley data analytics stack","","4","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Dynamic graphics for research and teaching, with applications in the life sciences","M. Greenacre","Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain","Proceedings of the ITI 2009 31st International Conference on Information Technology Interfaces","","2009","","","15","16","Our ability to record increasingly larger and more complex sets of data is accompanied by a decline in our capacity to interpret and understand these data in the fullest sense. Multivariate analysis partially assists us in our quest by reducing the dimensionality in optimal ways, but our view is stuck in two dimensions because of the planar nature of the graphical medium, be it the printed page or the computer screen. We are developing protocols and tools to explore dynamically high-dimensional data. The key idea is to introduce motion into the visualization process - not only can movement enlarge our view of data into the third dimension but it also allows us to see phenomena that are buried in the ""deep space"" of the data. Using the freely available R language and modern methods of statistical learning and data mining, we construct animation sequences that take us on a dynamic journey through our data. As scientific publishing evolves more and more into electronic formats, the potential of dynamic graphics will change forever the way we visualize and interpret data. Dynamic graphics also affords a valuable teaching tool, for explaining and demonstrating complex concepts such as multivariate relationships and differences between multivariate methods. The presentation concentrates on applications in the life sciences using examples from epidemiology, population disease statistics and genomics.","","","10.1109/ITI.2009.5196043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5196043","","Graphics;Education;Data visualization;Protocols;Extraterrestrial phenomena;Statistical learning;Data mining;Animation;Scientific publishing;Diseases","computer aided instruction;data mining;data visualisation;statistical analysis;teaching","dynamic graphic;life science;multivariate analysis;computer screen;protocol;high-dimensional data;visualization process;R language;statistical learning;data mining;teaching tool;epidemiology;population disease statistic;genomics","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Role of test in yield learning for 65nm and beyond","S. Taneja","Vice President, General Manager, Encounter Test, Cadence Design Systems, Inc.","2006 IEEE International Test Conference","","2006","","","1","1","A robust design for test (DFT) architecture and the ability to detect small delay defects are not enough to meet all of today's customer requirements. Customers must also achieve expedient yield ramp especially in highly volatile and cost sensitive markets. This requires a stateof- the-art Volume Yield Diagnostics flow with a highly accurate diagnostic engine and a deep integration extending into the design domain. With the advent of nanometer technologies, design yields are more often limited by context sensitive design ""features"" (wire length, contact closure distance, via formation etc.) than by random particle defects. In order to bridge the gap between feature-limited and defect-limited yield loss, diagnostics based yield ramp and yield learning technologies must be deeply integrated into the design layout to identify exact locations on the die where yield loss is the greatest and more importantly, provide a closed loop system to enhance DFM models, library design and design rules for higher yielding designs. This situation at 65 and 45nm is moving the EDA industry from that of a supplier of point tools to the role of a partner proactively anticipating and delivering on customers¿ needs, it is becoming increasingly clear that our customers expect systematic delivery of Testability solutions from system to silicon.","","","10.1109/TEST.2006.297770","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4079448","","Timing;System testing;Design for testability;Delay;Manufacturing;Automatic test pattern generation;Electronic design automation and methodology;Robustness;Design optimization;Failure analysis","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The transition from the IEEE International SOI Conference to the IEEE S3S conference was successful by any measurement. The first year of the new conference leading-edge experts from 3D Integration, Sub-threshold Microelectronics and SOI fields gathered and we established a world class international venue to present, learn and debate about these exciting topics. The overall participation at the first year of the new conference grew by over 50%, and the overall quality and quantity of the technical content grew even more. This year we are looking forward to continuing to enhance the content of the 2014 S3S Conference. On Monday, Oct. 6 we will feature two Short Courses that will run in parallel. Short courses are an educational venue where new comers can gain overview and generalists can learn more details about new and timely topics. The short course on Monolithic 3D will be a full day deep dive into the topic of three-dimensional integration without the use of stacking patterned wafers by using through vias. Already there are extremely successful examples of monolithic 3D Flash Memory. Looking beyond this initial application, we will explore the application of monolithic 3D to alternate memories like RRAM, CMOS systems with silicon and other channel materials like III V. In addition, a significant portion of the short course will be dedicated to the exciting opportunity of Monolithic 3D in the context of CMOS Logic. The other short course we will offer this year is entitled Power Efficient Chip Technology. This short course will address several key aspects of power-efficiency including low power transistors and circuits. The course will also review in detail the impact of design and architecture on the energy-efficiency of systems. The short course chairs as well as the instructors are world class leading experts from the most prestigious industry and academic institutions.","","","10.1109/S3S.2014.7028177","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7028177","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At least this is how it works in theory and simulation. In practice, however, a thorough understanding of the system, the use model, and the market is often far more important than the differences between any two optimization algorithms. Knowing when and where a particular algorithm is useful is typically at the heart of real control problems. The session, through a series of four talks by presenters with deep industrial experience, will describe a set of industrial control problems. These problems will provide context for control designs.
