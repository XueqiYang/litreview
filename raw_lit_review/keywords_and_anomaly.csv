In this context, secure transmission of data plays a critical role in realizing all of the key requirements of social multimedia networks such as reliability, scalability, quality of information, and quality of service (QoS). Thus, a trust-based paradigm for multimedia analytics is highly desired to meet the increasing user requirements and deliver more timely and actionable insights. In this regard, software-defined networks (SDNs) play a vital role; however, several factors such as as-runtime security, and energy-aware networking limit its capabilities to facilitate efficient network control and management. Thus, with the view to enhance the reliability of the SDN, a hybrid deep-learning-based anomaly detection scheme for suspicious flow detection in the context of social multimedia is proposed. It consists of the following two modules: (1) an anomaly detection module that leverages improved restricted Boltzmann machine and gradient descent-based support vector machine to detect the abnormal activities, and (2) an end-to-end data delivery module to satisfy strict QoS requirements of the SDN, that is, high bandwidth and low latency. Finally, the proposed scheme has been experimentally evaluated on both real-time and benchmark datasets to prove its effectiveness and efficiency in terms of anomaly detection and data delivery essential for social multimedia. Further, a large-scale analysis over a Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)-based insider threat dataset has been conducted to identify its performance in terms of detecting malicious events such as-Identity theft, profile cloning, confidential data collection, etc.","","","10.1109/TMM.2019.2893549","National Funding from the FCT—Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia; Finep, with resources from Funttel; Centro de Referência em Radiocomunicações—CRR project of the Instituto Nacional de Telecomunicações (Inatel), Brazil; Brazilian National Council for Research and Development (CNPq); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8613868","Anomaly detection;deep learning;flow routing;software defined networks;social multimedia","Anomaly detection;Security;Social network services;Iron;Routing;Support vector machines;Quality of service","Boltzmann machines;computer network security;gradient methods;learning (artificial intelligence);multimedia computing;multimedia systems;social networking (online);software defined networking;support vector machines;telecommunication computing","Carnegie Mellon University;deep-learning-ased anomaly detection;secure transmission;Boltzmann machine;trust-based paradigm;social multimedia networks;gradient descent-based support vector machine;anomaly detection module;SDN;energy-aware networking;software-defined networks","","15","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

By large we mean lines of code in the range of hundreds of thousands or millions. Our research objective is to improve the process of handling anomaly reports for large organizations. Specifically, we are addressing the problem of the manual, laborious and time consuming process of assigning anomaly reports to the correct design teams and the related issue of localizing faults in the system architecture. In large organizations, with complex systems, this is particularly problematic because the receiver of an anomaly report may not have detailed knowledge of the whole system. As a consequence, anomaly reports may be assigned to the wrong team in the organization, causing delays and unnecessary work. We have so far developed two machine learning prototypes to validate our approach. The latest, a re-implementation and extension, of the first is being evaluated on four large systems at Ericsson AB. Our main goal is to investigate how large software development organizations can significantly improve development efficiency by replacing manual anomaly report assignment and fault localization with machine learning techniques. Our approach focuses on training machine learning systems on anomaly report databases; this is in contrast to many other approaches that are based on test case execution combined with program sampling and/or source code analysis.","","","10.1109/ICSE.2013.6606717","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6606717","Automatic Fault Localization;Anomaly Handling;Bug Assignment;Machine Learning;Stacked generalization;Large Software Systems;Ontologies","Organizations;Accuracy;Semantics;Databases;Ontologies;Routing;Software","learning (artificial intelligence);organisational aspects;program testing;software architecture;software development management;software fault tolerance;software maintenance;source coding","machine learning;complex software system;system architecture;software development organization;software development efficiency;manual anomaly report assignment;fault localization;training;anomaly report database;test case execution;program sampling;source code analysis;software maintenance;anomaly handling efficiency","","1","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One such challenge is the autonomic detection of sleeping cells in cellular networks. Sleeping Cell (SC) is a cell degradation problem, and a special case in Cell Outage Detection (COD) because it does not trigger any alarm due to hardware or software problems in the BS. To minimize the effect of such outages, researchers have proposed autonomous outage detection and compensation solutions. State-of-the-art SC detection depends on drive tests and subscriber complaints to identify the effected cells. However, this approach is quickly becoming unsustainable due to rising operational expenses. To address this particular issue, we employ a Deep Learning based framework which uses Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT) functionality introduced in LTE networks. In our proposed framework, MDT measurements are used to train the deep learning model. Anomalies or cell outages in the network can be then quickly detected and localized, thus significantly reducing the duty cycle of self-healing process in SON. In our simulation setup, we also quantitatively compare and demonstrate superior performance of our proposed approach with state of the art machine learning algorithm such as One Class SVM using multiple performance metrics.","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2018.8647689","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8647689","Self Organizing Networks (SON);Self-healing;Anomaly Detection;Sleeping Cells;Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT);Deep Autoencoders;One Class SVM","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Data models;Interference;Training data;Cellular networks;Databases","cellular radio;learning (artificial intelligence);Long Term Evolution;support vector machines;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability","autonomous outage detection;compensation solutions;state-of-the-art;subscriber complaints;effected cells;operational expenses;LTE networks;deep learning model;next generation cellular networks;mobile cellular network operators;autonomic detection;cell degradation problem;deep learning based framework;cell outage detection;growing subscriber quality of experience demands;self-healing process;SON;minimization of drive tests functionality;MDT","","2","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the requirement for high reliability, DL systems are difficult to test. Existing DL testing work focuses on testing the DL models, not the implementations (e.g., DL software libraries) of the models. One key challenge of testing DL libraries is the difficulty of knowing the expected output of DL libraries given an input instance. Fortunately, there are multiple implementations of the same DL algorithms in different DL libraries. Thus, we propose CRADLE, a new approach that focuses on finding and localizing bugs in DL software libraries. CRADLE (1) performs cross-implementation inconsistency checking to detect bugs in DL libraries, and (2) leverages anomaly propagation tracking and analysis to localize faulty functions in DL libraries that cause the bugs. We evaluate CRADLE on three libraries (TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano), 11 datasets (including ImageNet, MNIST, and KGS Go game), and 30 pre-trained models. CRADLE detects 12 bugs and 104 unique inconsistencies, and highlights functions relevant to the causes of inconsistencies for all 104 unique inconsistencies.","","","10.1109/ICSE.2019.00107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8812095","deep learning software testing;cross-implementation testing;bugs detection;software testing","Libraries;Computer bugs;Testing;Training;Atmospheric modeling;Task analysis;Deep learning","learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;program debugging;software libraries","cross-backend validation;deep learning libraries;deep learning systems;DL software libraries;CRADLE;cross-implementation inconsistency checking;anomaly propagation tracking","","2","75","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Simple statistical analysis methods cannot fully capture log information for effective abnormal detection of software systems. In this paper, we propose to analyze the logs by combining feature extraction methods from natural language processing and anomaly detection methods from deep learning. Two feature extraction algorithms, Word2vec and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), are respectively adopted and compared here to obtain the log information, and then one deep learning method named Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is applied for the anomaly detection. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare LSTM with other machine learning algorithms, including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) and Naïve Bayes, the results show that LSTM can perform the best for anomaly detection of system logs with both of the two feature extraction methods, indicating that LSTM can capture contextual semantic information effectively in log anomaly detection and will be a promising tool for log analysis.","","","10.1109/ICFSP.2018.8552075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8552075","anomaly detection;Word2vec;TF-IDF;LSTM;log analysis;natural language processing","Anomaly detection;Feature extraction;Logic gates;Semantics;Boosting;Decision trees","Bayes methods;decision trees;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);natural language processing;pattern classification;statistical analysis;text analysis","long short-term memory;machine learning algorithms;deep learning method;anomaly detection methods;feature extraction methods;software systems;effective abnormal detection;log information;simple statistical analysis methods;rich semantic information;natural language processing;system logs;log anomaly detection;contextual semantic information;LSTM","","","17","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Predicting failures before their occurrence by detecting anomalies in system metrics is a viable solution to enable failure preventing or mitigating actions. The most promising approaches for predicting failures exploit statistical analysis or machine learning to reveal anomalies and their correlation with possible failures. Statistical analysis approaches result in far too many false positives, which severely hinder their practical applicability, while accurate machine learning approaches need extensive training with seeded faults, which is often impossible in operative cloud systems. In this paper, we propose EmBeD, Energy-Based anomaly Detection in the cloud, an approach to detect anomalies at runtime based on the free energy of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) model. The free energy is a stochastic function that can be used to efficiently score anomalies for detecting outliers. EmBeD analyzes the system behavior from raw metric data, does not require extensive training with seeded faults, and classifies the relation of anomalous behaviors with future failures with very few false positives. The experimental results presented in this paper confirm that EmBeD can precisely predict failure-prone behavior without training with seeded faults, thus overcoming the main limitations of current approaches.","","","10.1109/ICST.2019.00024","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8730157","anomaly detection, failure prediction, cloud reliability, machine learning","Training;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Stochastic processes;Data models;Measurement;Cloud computing","Boltzmann machines;cloud computing;learning (artificial intelligence);statistical analysis","EmBeD;failure-prone behavior;seeded faults;RBM anomaly detector;complex software systems;system metrics;statistical analysis approaches;extensive training;operative cloud systems;free energy;detecting outliers;system behavior;machine learning approaches;energy-based anomaly detection;restricted Boltzmann machine model;metric data;stochastic function","","1","53","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, the traditional approaches may not be sufficient. Thus, we propose machine learning classifiers to predict the system's health status. We evaluated our approach in an industrial case study, on a large, real-world dataset of 7.5 ·106 data points for 231 features.

The paper emphasizes on the possible implementation of a centralized IOT ""ecosystem"" and leaves the decentralized version for future discussion. The network is adhoc in nature to allow for devices for an easy ""connect-&-transmit"" process. Given a centralized compute-storage server, a user setups multiple devices like cell phones, camera-microphone enabled smartphones, high quality video recorders, and registers the specific devices to the central server which we call ""Control"".

In addition to this, the data stream can be studied and analysed for specific patterns during specific periods corresponding to exceptional situations like device malfunctions.

In order to monitor and control the process under test, we give an idea of introducing artificial intelligence technology and status feedback into the model, and also try to use virtual execution technology for testing. We use this technique based on the Extended EAI model to experiment on Internet work Operation System (IOS) software, and detect that some services of certain protocols running in IOS software have vulnerabilities. So the experimental results indicate that our method is feasible.","","","10.1109/WCSE.2009.174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5319549","Extended EAI Model;Vulnerability;Software Testing","Software testing;Software quality;Automation;Automatic testing;Process control;Artificial intelligence;Feedback;Web and internet services;Software systems;Protocols","artificial intelligence;operating systems (computers);program testing;software quality","software vulnerability testing;extended EAI model;software development life cycle;software quality;model-based software testing;extended environment-application interaction model;artificial intelligence technology;virtual execution technology;internetwork operation system software;status feedback","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rule learning, neural networks, statistics, and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are some of the kinds of representative methods for intrusion detection. Among them, neural networks are known for good performance in learning system-call sequences. In order to apply this knowledge to real-world problems successfully, it is important to determine the structures and weights of these call sequences. However, finding the appropriate structures requires very long time periods because there are no suitable analytical solutions. In this paper, a novel intrusion-detection technique based on evolutionary neural networks (ENNs) is proposed. One advantage of using ENNs is that it takes less time to obtain superior neural networks than when using conventional approaches. This is because they discover the structures and weights of the neural networks simultaneously. Experimental results with the 1999 Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Intrusion Detection Evaluation (IDEVAL) data confirm that ENNs are promising tools for intrusion detection.","","","10.1109/TSMCB.2005.860136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1634649","Anomaly detection;computer security;evolutionary algorithms;intrusion detection system (IDS);neural networks","Neural networks;Intrusion detection;Hidden Markov models;Computer security;Machine learning;Statistics;Evolutionary computation;Data security;Information security;Pattern matching","evolutionary computation;neural nets;security of data;learning (artificial intelligence)","evolutionary neural network;anomaly detection;program behavior;machine learning techniques;system-call audit data;intrusion detection;system-call sequences;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency","Algorithms;Artificial Intelligence;Computer Security;Evolution;Neural Networks (Computer);Pattern Recognition, Automated;Software;Software Validation","78","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The challenge of 5G is to assure the network performance and different quality of service (QoS) requirements of different services, such as machine type communication (MTC), enhanced mobile broad band (eMBB), and ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC) over 5G networks. Unlike the previous ”one size fits all” system, the softwarization, slicing and network capability exposure of 5G provide dynamic programming capabilities for QoS assurance. With the increasing complexity and dynamics of the network behaviors, it is non-trivial for a programmer to develop traditional software codes to schedule the network resources based on expert knowledge, especially when there is no quantitative relationship among the network events and the QoS anomalies. Machine learning is a computer technology that gives computer systems the ability to learn with data and improve performance and accuracy of decision making on a specific task, without being explicitly programmed. The areas of machine learning and communication technology are converging. Supervised learning based QoS assurance architecture for 5G networks was proposed in this paper. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can intelligently learn the network environment and react to dynamic situations. They can learn from the fore passed QoS related information and anomalies, and further reconstruct the relationship between the fore passed data and the current QoS related anomalies automatically and accurately. They, then, can trigger automatic mitigation or provide suggestions. The supervised machine learning mechanisms can also predict future QoS related anomalies with high confidence. In this paper, a case study for QoS anomaly root cause tracking based on decision tree was given to validate the proposed framework architecture.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2907142","Hubei Province Technology Innovation Project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8673765","5G;architecture;quality of service;supervised learning","5G mobile communication;Quality of service;Machine learning;Supervised learning;Computer architecture;Training;Knowledge engineering","5G mobile communication;decision making;decision trees;dynamic programming;learning (artificial intelligence);quality of service;synchronisation;telecommunication computing;telecommunication network reliability","supervised machine learning mechanisms;QoS anomaly root cause tracking;QoS assurance architecture;5G networks;ubiquitous connectivity;high-speed data transfer;machine type communication;enhanced mobile broad band;ultra-reliable low latency communications;network capability exposure;dynamic programming capabilities;network resources;computer technology;computer systems;communication technology;quality of service;software codes;URLLC;MTC;eMBB","","1","33","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recent days, machine learning techniques have been used to classify network traffic. In particular, semi-supervised learning is very fit for practical scenarios, where pre-labelled training flows are hard to obtain. In this paper, a semi-supervised classification scheme is proposed for network traffic classification by using deep generative models. Specifically, the feature extractor module aims to automatically find representation features of raw traffic data in a lower dimensional feature space. Subsequently, using these representation features, a separated classifier is trained by the semi-supervised classification module. The method is verified with three different levels of datasets: Anomaly detection-level, protocol-level and application-level. The results show that our scheme can not only detect malware traffic, but also classify the traffic according to their protocol, application, and attack types. Using less than 20% labelled flows of the whole dataset, we can achieve the accuracy of over 95% which is a satisfying value compared with supervised learning method.","","","10.1109/FSKD.2018.8686880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8686880","network traffic classification;semi-supervised learning;deep generative model;feature representation learning;network anomaly detection","","invasive software;protocols;supervised learning;telecommunication traffic","supervised learning method;semisupervised network traffic classification;deep generative models;network management;machine learning techniques;semisupervised learning;pre-labelled training flows;semisupervised classification scheme;feature extractor module;representation features;raw traffic data;lower dimensional feature space;semisupervised classification module;malware traffic","","","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A botnet attack typically works by infecting a device with malware and then recruiting it into a network of infected devices controlled by an attacker, which may lead to severe economic and social consequences. As a result, a considerable amount of research has been conducted to detect and prevent such attacks. In this paper, we create a foundation for an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to improve network security and to help reduce human involvement and error. The network traffic we used is captured in the form of connection logs, which are gen- erated by a popular network monitoring framework called Bro. We use our proposed framework to compare the performances of multiple supervised learning approaches, including Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest RF and Neural Networks (NN) at anomaly detection. We evaluated these models using F1 Score and Area Under Curve (AUC). Our models are trained on malicious network traffic samples from pervasive botnets like Zeus, Miuref and Conficker, as well as benign traffic samples. Using traditional cross validation, we illustrate that Random Forest has the best performance for anomaly detection. To test each algorithm's ability to generalize to unseen bot types, we implemented a custom-designed Leave-One-Out Cross Validation (LOBO-CV). In this procedure, each algorithm is trained on all but one bot family and evaluated on their ability to detect the unknown botnet traffic. We then improved overall detection performance by ensembling our two best models. Our results demonstrate we can detect both previously seen bot families and unseen botnet families with a high degree of confidence.","","","10.1109/IJCNN.2018.8489096","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489096","","Botnet;Hidden Markov models;Malware;Feature extraction;Protocols;Machine learning algorithms;IP networks","Bayes methods;computer network security;invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);neural nets;regression analysis;support vector machines","botnet traffic detection;network monitoring framework;SVM;Naive Bayes;Logistic Regression;traditional cross validation;benign traffic samples;pervasive botnets;malicious network traffic samples;anomaly detection;Neural Networks;Random Forest RF;Support Vector Machine;multiple supervised learning approaches;connection logs;anomaly-based intrusion detection system;infected devices;botnet attack;network security;Machine learning approaches","","1","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software failures. Autonomic failure detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloudwide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect failures, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled, and thus a prior failure history is not always available in production clouds, especially for newly managed or deployed systems. In this paper, we present an Adaptive Anomaly Detection (AAD) framework for cloud dependability assurance. It employs data description using hypersphere for adaptive failure detection. Based on the cloud performance data, AAD detects possible failures, which are verified by the cloud operators. They are confirmed as either true failures with failure types or normal states. The algorithm adapts itself by recursively learning from these newly verified detection results to refine future detections. Meanwhile, it exploits the observed but undetected failure records reported by the cloud operators to identify new types of failures. We have implemented a prototype of the algorithm and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment. Our experimental results show that AAD can achieve more efficient and accurate failure detection than other existing scheme.","","","10.1109/SRDS.2012.3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6424881","Cloud computing;Dependable systems;Failure detection;Autonomic management;Learning algorithms","Detectors;Kernel;Cloud computing;Support vector machines;Sensitivity;Equations","cloud computing;data acquisition;failure analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);recursive functions;security of data;software fault tolerance","cloud computing infrastructure;adaptive anomaly detection system;complex computing infrastructure maintenance;runtime problem;software failure;hardware failure;autonomic failure detection;self-managing cloud resource;system level dependability assurance;cloud execution monitoring;runtime performance data collection;adaptive failure detection;AAD;recursive learning;cloud operator","","17","5","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are the challenges in SDN environments. Despite a large number of DDoS detection and mitigation techniques exist in today, DDoS attacks continue to grow in attacks frequency, attacks volume and they are threatening the network security. There are two kinds of DDoS detection techniques; signature based and anomaly based detection. When the signature based detection technique uses network behaviors, the anomaly based detection uses machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose the design of SDN based detection for DDoS attack. In this propose system design, we use Advanced Support Vector Machine (ASVM) algorithm in order to detect DDoS attack. With the advantage of ASVM, it can significantly reduce the testing time as well as training time compared with SVM algorithm.

Manually building a model that is accurate enough in practice, however, is extremely difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for constructing models of CPS automatically, by applying supervised machine learning to data traces obtained after systematically seeding their software components with faults (""mutants""). We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on the simulator of a real-world water purification plant, presenting a framework that automatically generates mutants, collects data traces, and learns an SVM-based model. Using cross-validation and statistical model checking, we show that the learnt model characterises an invariant physical property of the system.

Software Defined Network (SDN) Technology has increasingly become essential in many advanced computer networks, including those in modern CPS, to provide flexible and agile network development. Despite many benefits that SDN offers, malicious attacks that can eventually prevent network services are unavoidable. Among the most predominant attacks on SDN controller layer, Link Discovery Attack and ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Spoofing Attack are fundamental in that they are the gateways of many other SDN threats and attacks. To defend these attacks, most existing techniques either rely on relatively complex data validation techniques or use thresholds that can be subjective and unable to detect more than one type of attacks at a time if one deciding factor is used. While Big data technology, particularly machine learning, has been widely used for intrusion/anomaly detection, little has been done in SDN. This paper explores how well this technology can be used to predict these SDN attacks. By employing typical machine learning algorithms on simulated data of routing in SDN when attacks occur, preliminary results, obtained from four machine learning models, show the average area under ROC curve of over 96% and 92% for sample size 50,970 (12 switches) and 60,000 (20 switches), respectively. Further experiments show near-linear scaling in training time for the best performing algorithm when sample size grows up to 100,000.","","","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622524","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622524","Software-Defined Networking;SDN-specific security;Link Discovery attack;ARP Spoofing attack;Machine Learning;Data Analytic Applications","Control systems;Protocols;Software defined networking;Security;Big Data;Machine learning;Computer architecture","Big Data;computer network security;cyber-physical systems;data analysis;IP networks;learning (artificial intelligence);software defined networking","security attacks;Big data analytic approach;cyber-physical systems;flexible network development;agile network development;malicious attacks;SDN controller layer;SDN attacks;software defined network technology;computer networks;CPS;ARP spoofing attack;link discovery attack;address resolution protocol spoofing attack;machine learning;intrusion-anomaly detection","","1","23","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, deep learning has gained much popularity in medical image analysis due to its underlying precision and robustness. Many researchers have utilized deep learning for extracting retinal layers from OCT images. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no literature available that presents a robust segmentation framework that is able to extract retinal layers from OCT scans having different retinal pathological syndromes. Therefore, this paper presents a deep convolutional neural network and structure tensor-based segmentation framework (CNN-STSF) for the fully automated segmentation of up to eight retinal layers from normal as well as diseased OCT scans. First of all, the proposed framework computes coherent tensor from the candidate scan through which retinal layers are extracted. Afterwards, the pixels representing the layers are further classified using cloud based deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model trained on 1,200 retinal layers patches. CNN model in the proposed framework computes the probability of each layer pixels and assign it to be part of that layer for which it has the highest probability. The proposed framework was tested and validated on more than 39,000 retinal OCT scans from different publicly available datasets and from local Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO) dataset where it outperformed all the existing solutions by achieving the overall layer segmentation accuracy of 0.9375.","","","10.1109/HealthCom.2018.8531198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8531198","Convolutional neural network (CNN);Deep learning;AlexNet;Transfer learning","Retina;Tensile stress;Convolution;Image segmentation;Pathology;Computational modeling;Blindness","biomedical optical imaging;diseases;eye;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neural nets;optical tomography","optical coherence tomography scans;deep learning;deep convolutional neural network;structure tensor-based segmentation framework;layer segmentation accuracy;intraretinal layers;retinal OCT scans;retinal layer patches;retinal pathological syndromes","","","25","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Context Recognition (CR) is currently solved using machine and deep learning approaches that require realistic datasets with ground truth labels collected ""in-the-wild"" as users live their lives. In such studies, users periodically label their current context (current activity, body position, and location) while a mobile app continuously gathers sensor data. Unfortunately, users sometimes assign wrong or incomplete context labels, reducing the quality of the labeled dataset; and causing lower classification accuracy. We present COMEX, an interactive visual analytics tool that assists analysts in identifying instances of mislabeled context data to improve the quality of CA datasets. For this, we first provide a conceptual categorization of mislabeling error types. Thereafter we develop linked visualizations, augmented by anomaly scores indicating suspected labeling issues, which provide richer insights into the diverse characteristics of the target dataset. We validate our approach on an open source dataset that contains context information for 60 participants gathered over several days using smartphones.

However, due to their inherent complexity and large scale, production cloud computing systems are prone to various runtime problems caused by hardware and software faults and environmental factors. Autonomic anomaly detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To detect anomalous cloud behaviors, we need to monitor the cloud execution and collect runtime cloud performance data. These data consist of values of performance metrics for different types of failures, which display different correlations with the performance metrics. In this paper, we present an adaptive anomaly identification mechanism that explores the most relevant principal components of different failure types in cloud computing infrastructures. It integrates the cloud performance metric analysis with filtering techniques to achieve automated, efficient, and accurate anomaly identification. The proposed mechanism adapts itself by recursively learning from the newly verified detection results to refine future detections. We have implemented a prototype of the anomaly identification system and conducted experiments in an on-campus cloud computing environment and by using the Google data center traces.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and a decentralized worldwide payment system for digital currency where transactions take place among users without any intermediary. Bitcoin transactions are performed and verified by network nodes and then registered in a public ledger called blockchain, which is maintained by network entities running Bitcoin software. To date, this cryptocurrency is worth close to U.S. $150 billion and widely traded across the world. However, as Bitcoin's popularity grows, many security concerns are coming to the forefront. Overall, Bitcoin security inevitably depends upon the distributed protocols-based stimulant-compatible proof-of-work that is being run by network entities called miners, who are anticipated to primarily maintain the blockchain (ledger). As a result, many researchers are exploring new threats to the entire system, introducing new countermeasures, and therefore anticipating new security trends. In this survey paper, we conduct an intensive study that explores key security concerns. We first start by presenting a global overview of the Bitcoin protocol as well as its major components.

This unsupervised online algorithm has been demonstrated on several machine-learning tasks, including anomaly detection. Significant effort has been made in formalizing and applying the HTM algorithm to different classes of problems. There are few early explorations of the HTM hardware architecture, especially for the earlier version of the spatial pooler of HTM algorithm. In this paper, we present a full-scale HTM architecture for both spatial pooler and temporal memory. Synthetic synapse design is proposed to address the potential and dynamic interconnections occurring during learning. The architecture is interweaved with parallel cells and columns that enable high processing speed for the HTM. The proposed architecture is verified for two different datasets: MNIST and the European number plate font (EUNF), with and without the presence of noise. The spatial pooler architecture is synthesized on Xilinx ZYNQ-7, with 91.16% classification accuracy for MNIST and 90% accuracy for EUNF, with noise. For the temporal memory sequence prediction, firstand second-order predictions are observed for a 5-number long sequence generated from EUNF dataset and 95% accuracy is obtained. Moreover, the proposed hardware architecture offers 1364× speedup over the software realization.

Many approaches have been proposed with dominating machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques or its combination. High false positive rate is due to being more general while designing detection model. Rule-based network intrusion detection systems lack high false positive rate if any, because rules are tighter to individually known type of attack. Although anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems do not need prior knowledge of attack, it is still possible to imitate some rule-based specificity at certain level while designing detection model in order to reduce the false positive rate. The specificity being handled in this paper is the design of network intrusion detection system for TCP/IP network traffic. Then we propose a method to prepare quality clusters to build a network intrusion detection model. It has been surveyed that some research did not bring contribution to network based intrusion detection systems due to improperly preprocessed data especially during feature selection. In this paper, we propose an attribute selection method with basic TCP network features only. By doing so, the experiment confirms the false positive rate (0.2%) and maintains overall system accuracy (99.6 %).","","","10.1109/COMNETSAT.2016.7907421","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7907421","clustering;information security;intrusion detection system;network-based IDS;network security","Intrusion detection;Clustering algorithms;Telecommunication traffic;Software;Hardware;Clustering methods","computer network security;feature selection;learning (artificial intelligence);transport protocols","quality threshold distance;TCP-IP network traffic;anomaly-based network intrusion detection system;machine learning;artificial intelligence technique;rule-based network intrusion detection system;false positive rate reduction;quality cluster;feature selection;attribute selection method","","","11","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The arsenal to defend our devices from attack is constantly lagging behind the latest methods used by attackers to break into them and subsequently into our networks. To counteract this trend, we developed a distributed, scalable approach that harnesses the power of collaborative end-host detectors or sensors. Simulation results reveal order of magnitude improvements over stand-alone detectors in the accuracy of detection (fewer false alarms) and in the quality of detection (the ability to capture stealthy anomalies that would otherwise go undetected). Although these results arise out of a proof of concept in the arena of botnet detection in an enterprise network, they have broader applicability to the area of network self-manageability of pervasive computing devices. To test the efficacy of these ideas further, Intel Corporation partnered with British Telecommunications plc to launch a trial deployment. In this paper, we report on results and insights gleaned from the development of a testbed infrastructure and phased experiments; (1) the design of a re-usable measurement-inference architecture into which 3rd party sensor developers can integrate a wide variety of ldquoanomaly detectionrdquo algorithms to derive the same correlation-related performance benefits; (2) the development of a series of validation methodologies necessitated by the lack of mature tools and approaches to attest to the security of distributed networked systems; (3) the critical role of learning and adaptation algorithms to calibrate a fully-distributed architecture of varied devices in varied contexts, and (4) the utility of large-scale data collections to assess what's normal behavior for Enterprise end-host background traffic as well as malware command-and-control protocols.

The proliferation of virtualization creates a new technique for the detection of such attacks. In this paper, we propose to design a rootkit detection mechanism for virtual machines through deep information extracting and reconstruction at the hypervisor level. Through accessing the important components of a VM such as the kernel symbol table, the hypervisor can reconstruct the VM's execution states and learn the essential information such as the running processes, active network connections, and opened files. Through cross-verification among the different components of the reconstructed execution states of the VM, we can detect both the hidden information and the anomaly connections among them. We implement our approach in Xen 4.1 with Linux VMs. Our experiments show that the hypervisor can efficiently reconstruct the semantic view of a VM's memory and identify the rootkits. Since the hypervisor accesses only the high level data structures, it has very limited impacts on the performance of VM.","","","10.1109/CNS.2013.6682767","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6682767","","Virtual machine monitors;Virtual machining;Kernel;Malware;Semantics;Linux;Image reconstruction","invasive software;Linux;virtual machines;virtualisation","rootkit detection;virtual machines;deep information extraction;stealth attacks detection;malware detection;virtualization;deep information reconstruction;hypervisor level;VM components;kernel symbol table;Xen 4.1;Linux VM","","2","20","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considering these facts, this paper focuses on anomaly detection on smartphones using their power consumption signals. These signals represent the dynamic behavior of the device due to the action of different hardware components controlled by one or many applications at the same time. This behavior can be seen as a non-stationary process due to the changes in time of its statistical properties. Considering this assumption, our methodology uses a feature extraction technique that is based on changepoint detection theory. Then, it fits three machine learning classifiers to inject diversity and maximize the detection performance.

Autonomic anomaly detection is a crucial technique for understanding emergent, cloud-wide phenomena and self-managing cloud resources for system-level dependability assurance. To identify anomalies, we need to monitor the system execution and collect health-related runtime performance data. These data are usually unlabeled and a prior failure history is not always available in production systems, especially for newly deployed or managed utility clouds. In this paper, we present a self-evolving anomaly detection framework with mechanisms for dependability assurance in utility clouds. No prior failure history is required. The detector self-evolves by recursively exploring newly generated verified detection results for future anomaly identification. Statistical learning technologies are exploited in detector determination and working dataset selection. Experimental results in an institute-wide cloud computing system show that the detection accuracy improves as it evolves. With self-evolvement, the detector can achieve 92.1% detection sensitivity and 83.8% detection specificity, which makes it well suitable for building highly dependable utility clouds.","","","10.1109/GLOCOM.2012.6503343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6503343","Cloud computing;Anomaly identification;Self evolvement;Dependable systems;Autonomic management","","cloud computing;data acquisition;learning (artificial intelligence);resource allocation;software performance evaluation;software reliability;statistical analysis","self-evolving anomaly detection framework;highly dependable utility cloud computing;resource management;failure management;cloud-wide phenomena;self-managing cloud resource;autonomic anomaly detection accuracy;emergent cloud-wide phenomena;system-level dependability assurance;health-related runtime performance data collection;dependability assurance;statistical learning technologies;detector determination;working dataset selection;institute-wide cloud computing system","","11","46","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The manual management of software is costly and sometimes error-prone. The other solution is autonomic computing that induces self-management capabilities, “self-*services”, in software systems with the help of autonomic managers. The design quality of a self-management capability affects the computing infrastructure regarding processing load, the memory requirement, data channel demand and performance of perturbation restore. It is critical to assess the design quality of a self-management capability to determine its effect over the computing infrastructure when it gets invoke against some anomaly or perturbation. Moreover, there are two possible host environments for an autonomic manager to offer a self-management capability as a self-* service: the local environment and the cloud environment. A criterion is needed to decide which environment is more suitable and cost-effective to run the service. However, the literature lacks in the assessment of the design quality metrics on self-management capabilities and the suitability and cost-effectiveness of the execution environment. In this work, we have proposed a suite of design quality metrics to determine the design quality of self-management capabilities. We validate the proposed metrics with a stock trade & forecasting system that was designed as an autonomic computing system with self-management capabilities. The proposed metrics were applied to define functions that identify the suitable and cost-effective execution environment for the self-* service. The results proved that these metrics are useful in determining the design quality, suitability, and cost-effectiveness of a self-* capability for an autonomic computing system. The proposed metrics can be used to compare differently designed autonomic solutions for complexity, efficiency, performance, understandability, and maintainability.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2944119","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8849995","Autonomic computing;design quality metrics;self-management capabilities;self-* service;stock trade forecasting","Measurement;Perturbation methods;Complexity theory;Computational modeling;Autonomic systems;Quality of service","software development management;software fault tolerance;software maintenance;software metrics","software maintenance;software management;stock trade and forecasting system;self-*service;cost-effective execution environment;cloud environment;autonomic solutions;computing infrastructure;autonomic manager;self-management capability;autonomic computing system;cost effectiveness;design quality metrics","","","39","CCBY","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To validate system- level goals, the prototype software for the system needs to be coupled with high-fidelity physics simulations of the hardware and the environment. The associated state spaces are massive and contain nonlinear and stochastic elements (like weather models) that formal methods do not currently treat easily. Testing methods that use machine learning have been shown to aid in exploring such systems. In particular, blind source selection methods can aid in intelligently reducing the state space, and feature selection methods can be used to choose input space features leading to desired or undesired output space behavior. When the global state space is too large to solve explicitly, we can use machine learning and statistical techniques to build models of the system. These simpler models enable us to predict behavior in the high-fidelity simulation, then adaptively refine the models as we test our predictions. This paper uses model-based testing to exercise a new air traffic control concept. The concept is implemented in software that helps controllers detect and resolve short-term conflicts between aircraft in the terminal airspace. The rules that determine whether or not aircraft are sufficiently separated within 40 miles of the terminal depend on aircraft weight, the flight rules, the type of approach, and whether the aircraft is arriving or departing. We show that model-based testing automates the process of feature selection and state-space reduction, enabling the analyst to quickly validate expected behavior and explore anomalies.","","","10.1109/DASC.2011.6096125","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6096125","","Testing;Aircraft;Atmospheric modeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Trajectory;Adaptation models;Clustering algorithms","aerospace computing;aerospace testing;air traffic control;learning (artificial intelligence);stochastic processes","system-level failures;flight-critical software systems;NextGen civil aviation capabilities;prototype software;high-fidelity physics simulations;stochastic elements;nonlinear elements;testing methods;machine learning;blind source selection methods;feature selection methods;global state space;statistical techniques;model-based testing;air traffic control concept;short-term conflicts;flight rules;state-space reduction","","1","29","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, web usage has become pervasive to touch all aspects of our life, economy and education.

According to White Hat security's “2015 Website Security Statistics Report” more than 86% of all websites have one or more critical vulnerability and the likelihood of information leakage is 56%. With no effective website security measures in place, one can expect the website security to be even more critical. The main research goal of this paper is to overcome this challenge by presenting an online anomaly behavior analysis of websites (e.g., HTML files) to detect any malicious codes or pages that have been injected by web attacks. Our anomaly analysis approach utilizes feature selection, data mining, data analytics and statistical techniques to identify accurately the webpage contents that have been compromised or can be exploited by attacks such as phishing attacks, cross site scripting attacks, html injection attacks, malware insertion attacks, just to name a few.

Reading logs provides insights on its activity, assess its correct state and allows to diagnose problems. However, reading does not scale: with the number of machines increasingly rising, and the complexification of systems, the task of auditing systems' health based on logfiles is becoming overwhelming for system administrators. This observation led to many proposals automating the processing of logs. However, most of these proposal still require some human intervention, for instance by tagging logs, parsing the source files generating the logs, etc. In this work, we target minimal human intervention for logfile processing and propose a new approach that considers logs as regular text (as opposed to related works that seek to exploit at best the little structure imposed by log formatting). This approach allows to leverage modern techniques from natural language processing. More specifically, we first apply a word embedding technique based on Google's word2vec algorithm: logfiles' words are mapped to a high dimensional metric space, that we then exploit as a feature space using standard classifiers. The resulting pipeline is very generic, computationally efficient, and requires very little intervention. We validate our approach by seeking stress patterns on an experimental platform. Results show a strong predictive performance (≈ 90% accuracy) using three out-of-the-box classifiers.","","","10.1109/ISSRE.2017.43","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8109100","Anomaly detection;logfile;NLP;word2vec;machine learning;VNF","Natural language processing;Tools;Standards;Training;Servers;Stress;Memory management","data mining;natural language processing;pattern classification;system monitoring;text analysis;word processing","feature space;standard classifiers;word embedding technique;log formatting;logfile processing;minimal human intervention;system state;event logging;anomaly detection;natural language processing;log mining","","6","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Software tools are developed to detect suspicious transactions usually based on knowledge from experts in the domain, but as new criminal tactics emerge, detection mechanisms must be updated. Suspicious activity examples are scarce or nonexistent, hindering the use of supervised machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing financial information without the use of ground truth. A user suspicion ranking is generated in order to facilitate human expert validation using an ensemble of anomaly detection algorithms. We apply our procedure over two case studies: one related to bank fund movements from a private company and the other concerning Ripple network transactions.

Artificial or contrived training data may not provide a realistic view of the deployment environment. Most realistic data sets are dirty; that is, they contain a number of attacks or anomalous events. The size of these high-quality training data sets makes manual removal or labeling of attack data infeasible. As a result, sensors trained on this data can miss attacks and their variations. We propose extending the training phase of AD sensors (in a manner agnostic to the underlying AD algorithm) to include a sanitization phase. This phase generates multiple models conditioned on small slices of the training data. We use these ""micro- models"" to produce provisional labels for each training input, and we combine the micro-models in a voting scheme to determine which parts of the training data may represent attacks. Our results suggest that this phase automatically and significantly improves the quality of unlabeled training data by making it as ""attack-free"" and ""regular"" as possible in the absence of absolute ground truth. We also show how a collaborative approach that combines models from different networks or domains can further refine the sanitization process to thwart targeted training or mimicry attacks against a single site.","","","10.1109/SP.2008.11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4531146","","Casting;Training data;Traffic control;Intrusion detection;Computer security;Data security;Data privacy;Computer science;Telecommunication traffic;Application software","learning (artificial intelligence);security of data","anomaly detection sensor;high-quality training data set;sanitization phase;voting scheme;collaborative approach","","47","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Land mines can be detected with high precision through active detectors. However, the operating principle of active detectors can also lead to vital dangers. When detecting mines in the field, electrical signals sent to the environment from active detectors sometimes trigger the mine blasting mechanism and cause mine explosion. Another way to detect land mines without triggering the blasting mechanisms is to use passive detectors. The biggest handicap of passive detectors is that they cannot detect mines as much as active detectors. This causes that passive detectors are as dangerous as at least active detectors. In this case, passive detectors can cause dangerous results like active detectors. In this paper, we have developed solutions that eliminate the handicaps of passive mine detectors. For this purpose, a new approach, which is established on artificial intelligence based on the magnetic anomaly, measurement height, and soil type, is suggested. The experimental setup is designed to verify and test the proposed approach. In this respect, the actual data measured under different conditions were recorded and processed with modern and effective artificial intelligence techniques; and alternative models were developed. With the proposed approach, the mines are detected with a success rate of 98.2%. This success rate in detection is promising for the passive mine detectors. A significant contribution of the developed model in terms of literature is the successful classification as well as the detection of mines. In experimental studies conducted with real data, five different types of mines are classified as 85.8% success rate. The proposed model has been a pioneering study on mine classification in the literature. Moreover, the realization of this paper with a passive mine detector proves the success of the proposed approach.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2866538","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443331","Mine detection and diagnosis;meta-heuristic classification;artificial neural network","Detectors;Landmine detection;Magnetic field measurement;Ground penetrating radar;Soil;Magnetic fields;Soil measurements","artificial intelligence;image classification;landmine detection;military computing;soil","active detectors;mine blasting mechanism;passive mine detector;passive mine detection;land mine detection;mine explosion;hybrid model;passive mine classification method;electrical signals;measurement height;soil type;artificial intelligence techniques","","1","49","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

An IDS aims at capturing and repealing any malignant activities in the network before they can cause harmful destruction. An IDS relies on a well-trained classification model so the model is able to identify the presence of attacks effectively. This paper compares the performance of IDS by exerting random forest classifier with respect to two performance measures, i.e. accuracy and false alarm rate.

In recent years, the Semantic Web Rules Language has been proposed to add more expressiveness to the family of ontology languages. However the inclusion of rules has created new challenges of not only verifying the consistency of an ontology, but also checking for anomalies of a set of rules by itself. Currently automated tool support for reasoning about ontologies with rules is relatively limited compared to those for standard ontology reasoning. This paper addresses these challenges by defining notions of rule anomalies and proposing a method of discovering such anomalies by using the constraint logic programming technique and the state-of-the-art Semantic Web reasoners.","","","10.1109/SSIRI.2010.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5502859","Semantic Web;Logic Programming","Semantic Web;Ontologies;OWL;Logic programming;Vocabulary;Australia;Computer architecture;Service oriented architecture;Atomic layer deposition;Computer languages","constraint handling;knowledge representation languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);semantic Web","semantic Web rules;semantic Web ontology language;automated reasoning;automated tool support;anomaly discovery;constraint logic programming technique","","1","34","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These events are usually causally dependent to each other, reflecting the interactions and collaborations among different parties. Learning and interpreting the temporal patterns and dynamics within these event streams plays an important role in many practical applications, such as trend prediction and anomaly detection. Since causal dependencies can be reflected in both event time (i.e., when) and event content (i.e., who and what), we thus develop a user community based generative model, called latent Hawkes process (LHP), taking into account both-side information to illustrate the generation of such inter-dependent event streams on GitHub repositories, where each attribute is assumed to be generated by interplays between correlated latent communities. Through learning of our model, two functionalities are fulfilled concurrently: event clustering (i.e., community discovery) and temporal dependency learning among these clusters (i.e., dependency profiling). To do so, we design an EM-based framework integrating sequential Monte Carlo sampling to estimate model parameters in an end-to-end manner. Through experiments on practical GitHub event data, we validate the effectiveness of LHP in extracting user community structures and learning their correlated temporal dynamics. Such knowledge further enables us to gain new insights into the development status of software, such as the project persistence and anomaly detection.","","","10.1109/ICDCS.2019.00128","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8884839","Github, Temporal Point Process, Graphical Model, Time Series Analysis","Graphical models;Bayes methods;Social networking (online);Software;History;Computational modeling;Anomaly detection","learning (artificial intelligence);Monte Carlo methods;pattern clustering;sampling methods;social networking (online);software engineering","latent Hawkes process model;event clustering;temporal dynamics learning;online social networks;temporal patterns;anomaly detection;causal dependencies;inter-dependent event streams;GitHub repositories;latent communities;community discovery;dependency profiling;temporal dynamics;GitHub event data;Monte Carlo sampling","","","26","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many people are being benefited from the mobile healthcare services. Compared with the traditional healthcare services, patients' medical behavior trajectories can be recorded by mobile healthcare services meticulously. They monitor the entire healthcare services process and help to improve the quality and standardization of healthcare services. By tracking and analyzing the patients' medical records, they provide real-time protection for the patients' healthcare activities. Therefore, medical fraud can be avoided and the loss of public health funds can be reduced. Although mobile healthcare services can provide a large amount of timely data, an effective real-time online algorithm is needed due to the timeliness of detecting the medical insurance fraud claims. However, because of the complex granularity of medical data, existing fraud detection approaches tend to be less effective in terms of monitoring the healthcare services process. In this paper, we propose an approach to deal with these problems. By means of the proposed SSIsomap activity clustering method, SimLOF outlier detection method, and the Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method, our approach is able to detect unusual categories and frequencies of behaviors simultaneously. Our approach is applied to a real-world data set containing more than 40 million medical insurance claim activities from over 40000 users. Compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, the extensive experimental results show that our approach is significantly more effective and efficient. Our approach agent which provides decision support for the approval sender during the medical insurance claim approval process is undergoing trial in mobile healthcare services.","","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2875516","National Key R&D Program; NSFC; SDNSFC; Shandong Major Scientific and Technological Innovation Projects; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8489846","Data mining;medical information systems;pattern analysis;semisupervised learning","Insurance;Medical services;Manifolds;Anomaly detection;Real-time systems","decision support systems;fraud;health care;inference mechanisms;insurance data processing;learning (artificial intelligence);medical information systems;mobile computing;pattern clustering;security of data;uncertainty handling","mobile healthcare services;Dempster-Shafer theory-based evidence aggregation method;SimLOF outlier detection method;clustering method;medical insurance fraud claims;real-time online algorithm;public health funds;patients healthcare activities;patients medical records;patients medical behavior trajectories;manifold learning;fraud identification method","","1","22","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Commonly used signature-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) struggle to distinguish between these processes and are thus only of limited use to detect such attacks. They also have the shortcoming that they need to be updated frequently to possess the latest malware definitions. This makes them inherently prone to missing novel attack techniques. Misuse detection IDSs however overcome this problem by maintaining a ground truth of normal application behavior while reporting deviations as anomalies. In our approach, we try to accomplish this by observing a process' memory consumption. This is for two reasons: We expect the readings to be less volatile in comparison to for instance network operations. Second, by breaking the problem down, we are able to investigate thoroughly while still laying the foundations for future expansion. We use the observations from a given host to train a machine learning algorithm. After an initial learning phase, we evaluate the model with readings from the application it has been trained on and other applications in order to assess its quality. Our results indicate that the efficacy of this method is highly dependent on parametrizing the machine learning algorithm appropriately. A large variance in accuracy with only slightly altered inputs confirms this suggestion. We finish with a discussion on deploying such an IDS at scale in a realistic scenario.","","","10.1109/THS.2017.7943508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7943508","","Training;Malware;Memory management;Data models;Intrusion detection;Time series analysis","invasive software;learning (artificial intelligence);program diagnostics;security of data","disguised processes detection;application-behavior profiling;malware detection;system process hijacking;used signature-based intrusion detection systems;IDS;malware definitions;normal application behavior ground truth;process memory consumption;machine learning algorithm parametrization","","3","31","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Examples of such systems include sensor networks, the smart power grid, self-driven cars and autonomous drones. Such systems are driven by signal processing, control and learning algorithms that process sensor data, actuate control functions and learn about the environment in which these systems operate. The trustworthiness and safety of such systems is of paramount importance and has significant impact on the commercial viability of the underlying technology. As a consequence, anomalies in system operation due to computation errors in on-board processors, degradation and failure of embedded sensors, actuators and electro-mechanical subsystems and unforeseen changes in their operation environment need to detected with minimum latency. Such anomalies also need to be mitigated in ways that ensure the safety of such systems under all possible failure scenarios. Many future systems will be selflearning in the field. It is necessary to ensure that such learning does not compromise the safety of all human personnel involved in the operation of such systems. To enable safe operation of such systems, the underlying hardware needs to be tuned in the field to maximize performance, reliability and error-resilience while minimizing power consumption. To enable such dynamic adaptation, device operating conditions and the onset of soft errors are sensed using post-manufacture and real-time checking mechanisms. These mechanisms rely on the use of built-in sensors and/or low-overhead function encoding techniques to detect anomalies in system functions. A key capability is that of being able to deduce multiple performance parameters of the system-under-test using compact optimized stimulus using learning algorithms. The sensors and function encodings assess the loss in performance of the relevant systems due to workload uncertainties, manufacturing process imperfections, soft errors and hardware malfunction and failures induced by electromechanical degradation. These are then mitigated through the use of algorithm-through-circuit level compensation techniques based on pre-deployment simulation and post-deployment self-learning. These techniques continuously trade off performance vs. power of the individual software and hardware modules in such a way as to deliver the end-to-end desired application level Quality of Service (QoS), while minimizing energy/power consumption and maximizing reliability and safety. Applications to signal processing, and control algorithms for example autonomous systems will be discussed.","","","10.1109/VLSID.2018.20","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8326883","","Signal processing algorithms;Robot sensing systems;Signal processing;Safety;Real-time systems;Hardware;Electrical engineering","control engineering computing;failure analysis;quality of service;radiation hardening (electronics);signal processing","safe autonomous systems;real-time error detection;safety-critical signal processing;communications systems;every-day robotics;artificial intelligence;sensor networks;smart power grid;self-driven cars;autonomous drones;learning algorithms;on-board processors;electro-mechanical subsystems;system-under-test;algorithm-through-circuit level compensation techniques;post-deployment self-learning;energy/power consumption","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed algorithm makes the best use of Fog node capability to realize distributed data collection and processing. Via Fog-to-Fog connections, it can examine the sensor data by collecting them from different search ranges, whose values are meanwhile optimized. Numerical experiments conducted in a real indoor environment demonstrate that our algorithm achieve a high prediction accuracy for anomaly detection even with relatively small sensor data for processing. The effectiveness of Fog node placement is also verified.

Knowing this both in real time and from historical records would allow effective law enforcement and crime prevention. However, very little research has been devoted into identifying pickpocketing gangs in an automated and holistic manner. This research utilizes smart card data generated by bus riders to identify pickpocketing gangs, who possess distinct characteristics from regular passengers. Particularly, we create a dataset of 1,098 pickpockets among 4.06 million bus riders in August, 2015 in Beijing automatically and efficiently based on an efficient labeling model of outliers. This model examines anomaly of passengers using the so-called relative outlier cluster factor and local outlier factor. The proposed mobility patterns of pickpockets are then learned based on supervised classification. Pickpockets from the derived dataset form a pickpocketing network, which is modeled as a graph with vertices denoted as discrete pickpockets, and edge weight quantified by a combined similarity on mobility pattern, space and time. A graphbased Louvain algorithm is adopted to detect pickpocketing gangs. Experiments are conducted on SINA microblog data to verify the detected pickpocketing gangs identified by the proposed framework. Results show that the framework detects 63 pickpocketing gangs and verifies 34 gangs by microblogs, with recall value 0.85.

Sharing experiences simplifies learning, reducing costly trial and error in complex environments. However, integration produces dependencies that make constituent systems less robust to failures, unexpected outputs and performance anomalies. Even with APIs and reflective, self-aware techniques, system integration still requires expert programming and tuning. Self-integrating systems proposed in recent research automate integration, but can be challenging to validate at scale. We therefore propose CHARIOT, a common test environment to allow for different approaches and systems to be deployed, assessed and compared on a shared platform for the development of self-integrating systems. In this paper, we discuss the underlying requirements and challenges, potential metrics, and a system metamodel to accommodate these.","","","10.1109/FAS-W.2019.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8791947","System Integration;Testbed;Metamodel;Self Integration;Self Optimisation","Measurement;System integration;Runtime;Protocols;Adaptive systems;Complexity theory;Semantics","application program interfaces;computer networks;learning (artificial intelligence);software architecture","common test environment;shared platform;self-integrating systems;system metamodel;continuous high-level adaptive;integrated networked systems;common environment;CHARIOT;expert programming;system integration;performance anomalies;unexpected outputs;constituent systems;complex environments;costly trial;sharing experiences","","1","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Different features have different importance, which are often described by weights. So how to adaptively learning weights of different features is a very key issue in CBR, which impact directly the quality and performance of case extraction. Currently, in most practical CBR systems, the feature weights are given by domain experts subjectively. In this paper, we propose a PID operator-based feature weight learning method based on the fundamental theory of the control system. PID-based feature weighting method is a self-adaptive method, which utilizing the similar neural network architecture to construct the case base. Through designing 3 kinds of adjusting operators: Proportional, integral and derivative operator (PID), and each operator with different properties: reactive, prudent and sensitive, we can adjust the feature weight from different point of views, such as the current adjust results, the history results or the last two results. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the method, the experiment of network anomaly detection is conducted and the experimental results show that all 3 operators are effective which can converge the intrusion detection system into a stable state in relative small iterations.","","","10.1109/CSIE.2009.355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5170599","PID operators;Feature Weight Learning;Intrusion Detection","Intrusion detection;Computer science;Application software;Three-term control;Learning systems;Control systems;Neural networks;History;Indexing;Costs","adaptive control;case-based reasoning;learning (artificial intelligence);learning systems;neurocontrollers;security of data;self-adjusting systems;stability;three-term control","PID-based feature weight learning method;intrusion detection system;case-based reasoning;CBR system;adaptively learning weight;domain expert;self-adaptive method;neural network architecture;proportional-integral-and-derivative operator;network anomaly detection;stable state","","","16","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Multiple issues and challenges in discovering cloud services appear due to the lack of the cloud service description standardization. In fact, the existing cloud providers describe, their similar offered services in different ways. Thus, various existing works aim at standardizing the representation of cloud computing services while proposing ontologies. However, since the existing proposals were not evaluated, they might be less adopted and considered. Indeed, the ontology evaluation has a direct impact on its understandability and reusability. In this paper, we propose an evaluation approach to validate our proposed Cloud Service Ontology (CSO), to guarantee an adequate cloud service discovery. This paper contribution is threefold. First, it specifies a set of patterns and anti-patterns in order to evaluate CSO. Second, it defines an anti-pattern detection method based on SPARQL queries which provides a set of correction recommendations to help ontologists revise the ontology. Finally, some experiment tests were conducted in relation to: (i) the method efficiency and (ii) anti-pattern detection of design anomalies as well as taxonomic and domain errors within CSO.","","","10.1109/AICCSA.2016.7945776","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7945776","","Ontologies;Cloud computing;Redundancy;Virtual machining;Software as a service;Standards;Electronic mail","cloud computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query processing","cloud computing;on-demand computing services;cloud service description standardization;CSO evaluation;SPARQL queries;antipattern-based cloud ontology evaluation","","1","18","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
